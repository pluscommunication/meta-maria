  abstract = {Background Untreated depression and anxiety during the perinatal period have significant consequences on maternal and infant health; however, few studies have examined perinatal depression and perinatal anxiety in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The current study prospectively examined the prevalence of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety, and emotional support from family and friends, as well as childhood sexual abuse in women with and without HIV infection. Methods Between July 2009 and January 2013, 258 pregnant women receiving care in a Philadelphia hospital were enrolled, with 162 completing both the prenatal and postpartum portions of the study. The Center for Epidemiological Studies\textendash Depression Scale (CES-D), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults were used to measure depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. An independent samples t test and multiple linear regressions were used to determine associations among depression, anxiety, and pregnancy-related variables. Results Forty-nine participants (30\%) were living with HIV; 113 (70\%) were HIV negative. CES-D scores did not differ prenatally (p = .131) or postpartum (p = .156) between women with and without HIV. Prenatal state anxiety scores were higher in women with HIV (p = .02) but there were no differences postpartum (p = .432). In a multiple linear regression, trait anxiety predicted postpartum anxiety in the full sample (p \textexclamdown{} .001) and childhood sexual abuse predicted postpartum depression among women with HIV (p = .021). Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating perinatal depression and anxiety early in the prenatal period. Results also emphasize the need for providers to be aware of childhood sexual abuse as a potential correlate for depression in women with HIV.}

Aim To assess the perception of pregnant women on the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and the prevalence of common mental health disorders (CMHD) among pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 380 pregnant women at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan; participants were enrolled using a simple random sampling technique. Data was collected using pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Information obtained \textendash{} sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, perception and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, effect on ANC, coping mechanisms, and presence of CMHD (anxiety and depression) were measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data were analysed using STATA 16.0 Software. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed. The level of significance was p-value \textexclamdown{} 0.05. Results The mean age was 32 {$\pm$} 4.78 years, most respondents were \textexclamdown 35 years (75\%), married (97.1\%), had a higher education (89\%) and multiparous (70\%). About 43.9\% were worried that COVID-19 would affect pregnancy care, 42.9\% reported it affected care and 81.6\% were not worried it would affect the delivery care. Among respondents, 96.6\% were able to cope with the effects of the pandemic and 96.8\% enjoyed good social support. Respondents did not have CMHD (88.16\%), 7.9\% had CMHD (4.74\% had depression and 3.16\% had anxiety) and 3.95\% had co-morbid depression and anxiety. On multinomial regression analysis, relative to anxiety or depression only, respondents with combined depression and anxiety had higher odds of having no delivery plan and thought COVID-19 may affect their delivery. Conclusion Only a few women reported anxiety and depression symptoms during the lockdown and those with anxiety or combined symptoms of anxiety and depression had no birth plan and believed that COVID-19 would affect their delivery.},

  abstract = {Background While risk of depression appears greatest in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, few studies have examined prenatal depression and its comorbidity with anxiety in Africa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of prenatal depression and anxiety among pregnant women in Kenya, and to identify sociodemographic and health-related risk factors. Method A convenience sample of 395 pregnant women in their second or third trimesters was recruited. Depressive symptoms were screened for using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, with scores {$\geq$}12 indicating a high possibility of depression, and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale screened for anxiety with scores {$\geq$}10 indicating possible anxiety. Results Overall, 16.2\% and 6.6\% of women had depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and 12.5\% of those with depressive symptoms also had anxiety. Multivariate ordinal logistic regressions revealed that unplanned pregnancy, income status, and feeling less happy about the pregnancy were significant predictors of both depression and anxiety. Younger maternal age and having no history of seeking psychological help also significantly increased the odds of depression and anxiety, respectively. Limitation The study sample represents women in the upper end of the economic spectrum, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to the general population of women in Kenya. Conclusion Depression and anxiety were less prevalent than in previous studies from low-and-middle income countries (LMICs), but still signify a threat to maternal mental health and pose a risk to maternal mental health and infant developmental outcomes. Routine screening for depression is recommended to enable timely intervention.},

  abstract = {Chronic maternal ethanol exposure leads to poor intelligence, impaired cognition and array of neurological symptoms in offsprings and commonly referred as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Despite high prevalence and severity, the neurochemical basis of FASD remains largely unexplored. The present study evaluated the pharmacological effects of agmatine in cognitive deficits associated with FAS in rat's offsprings prenatally exposed to alcohol. Pregnant rats received ethanol in liquid modified diet during the entire gestational period of 21 days. Offsprings were treated with agmatine (20\textendash 80 mg/Kg, i.p.) during early postnatal days (PND: 21\textendash 35) and subsequently evaluated for anxiety in elevated plus maze (EPM), depression in forced swim test (FST) and learning and memory in Morris's water maze (MWM) during post adolescent phase. Hippocampal agmatine, BDNF, TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-6 levels were also analyzed in prenatally ethanol exposed pups. Offsprings prenatally exposed to ethanol demonstrated delayed righting reflex, reduced exploratory behavior along with anxiety, depression-like behavior and impaired memory. These behavioral abnormalities were correlated with a significant reduction in hippocampal agmatine and BDNF levels and elevation in TNF-{$\alpha$} and IL-6 immunocontent. Chronic agmatine (40 and 80 mg/Kg, i.p.) administration for 15 days (PND: 21\textendash 35), improved entries and time spent in open arm of EPM, decreased immobility time in FST. It also reduced latency to reach the platform location; increased the number of entries, time spent in platform quadrant and also number of crossing over platform quadrant when subjected to MWM test in prenatally ethanol exposed offsprings. This study provides functional evidences for the therapeutic potential of agmatine in cognitive impairment and other neurological complications associated with FASD.},

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Academic institution. Patient(s) Reproductive-aged women with PCOS (n = 189) and controls (n = 225). Intervention Administering the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations-Appearance Subscale (MBSRQ-AS), Stunkard Figure Rating Scale (FRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and PCOS quality of life survey (MPCOS-Q). Main Outcome Measure(s) BID, depression, and anxiety scores and mediation of depression and anxiety scores by BID. Result(s) Women with PCOS had worse BID scores on all five MBSRQ-AS subscales adjusted for age, body mass index, race, pregnancy history, income, and employment, and larger differences on the FRS compared with the control women. In multivariable regression models, the prevalence of depressive (28\% vs. 19.2\%) and anxiety (76.5\% vs. 56.5\%) symptoms were also statistically significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with the controls. Most MBSRQ-AS subscale scores statistically significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and quality of life scores. The association between PCOS/control status and higher anxiety and depression scores was completely mediated by the appearance evaluation and body areas satisfaction subscales and partially mediated by overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, and self-classified weight. Conclusion(s) Women with PCOS have increased BID and depressive and anxiety symptoms. In our study different aspects of BID either fully or partially mediated the association between PCOS/control status and depression and anxiety scores, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeted at improving body image may decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms.

La m\'econnaissance de la symptomatologie, sa proximit\'e avec le syndrome d\'epressif ou anxieux et le diagnostic d'exclusion \'evoqu\'e au sein du DSM-IV permettent d'expliquer ce relatif d\'esint\'er\^et de la part des m\'edecins.

Un diagnostic de trouble de l'adaptation bien pos\'e permet un traitement (psychoth\'erapie) adapt\'e et une revalidation rapide. Introduction This paper exposes the complexity and discrete characteristic of the adjustment disorder with reference to its clinical and scientific diagnosis. Even though the disorder occurs in frequent clinical circumstances after important life events, such as mobbing, burn-out, unemployment, divorce or separation, pregnancy denial, surgical operation or cancer, the adjustment disorder is often not considered in the diagnosis since better known disorders with similar symptoms prevail, such as major depression and anxiety disorder. Ten years ago, Bott\'ero had already noticed that the adjustment disorder diagnosis remained rather uncommon with reference to patients he was working with while Langlois assimilated this disorder with an invisible diagnosis. Methodology In order to maximize the data collection, we used the article review below and challenged their surveys and results: National Center for Biotechnology Information (NBCI \textendash{} Pubmed) for international articles and Cairn.info for French literature. Moreover, we targeted the following keywords on the search engine and used articles, which had been published from 1 February 1975 to 31 January 2015: ``adjustment'', ``adjustment disorder'' and the French translation ``trouble de l'adaptation''. Results One hundred and ninety-one articles matched our search criteria. However, after a closer analysis, solely 105 articles were selected as being of interest. Many articles were excluded since they were related to non-psychiatric fields induced by the term ``adaptation''. Indeed, the number of corresponding articles found for the adjustment disorder literally pointed-out the lack of existing literature on that topic in comparison to more known disorders such as anxiety disorder (2661 articles) or major depression (5481 articles). This represents up to 50 times more articles in comparison to the number of articles we found on adjustment disorder and up to 20 times more articles for the eating disorder (1994), although the prevalence is not significantly higher than for the adjustment disorder. According to their relevance and their content, we have split the articles into seven subcategories: 1. General description: most scientific articles generally describe the adjustment disorder as being a transition diagnosis, which is ambiguous, marginal and difficult to detect. The findings claim that only a few studies have been conducted on the adjustment disorder despite a high prevalence in the general population and in the clinical field. 2. Classification: the DSM-5 defined the adjustment disorder as a set of different outcomes and syndromes induced by stress after a difficult life event. While the link to other disorders has not been mentioned, the diagnosis of this disorder is no longer excluded or perceived as a secondary diagnosis. The DSM-5 faced criticism from three points of view: the operationalization of the concept of stress, the differential diagnosis and the description. 3. Prevalence: different samples have shown a significantly high prevalence of the adjustment disorder within the population. In addition to the psychiatric pain induced by difficult life events we need to emphasize the fact that 12.5 to 19.4 percent of the patients faced heavy and severe pathologies and depended on clinical care and treatment. 4. Etiology, comorbidity or associated symptomatology: the literature identified the tendency to commit suicide and stressful life events as being two fundamental characteristics of adjustment disorder. The third one is the personality profile. 5. Differential diagnosis: that motivates researchers to focus on the adjustment disorder: the differentiation approach as to the major depression. Indeed, the aetiology, the symptomatology and the treatment differ from the adjustment disorder. 6. Assessment: very recently, Dutch researchers have developed and validated the Diagnostic Interview Adjustment Disorder (DIAD). 7. Treatment: in 2014, no data or meta-analysis recommended drug treatment in addition to therapy. In fact, several authors have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of drug therapy. The literature suggests a psychotherapeutic approach to treat adjustment disorder. Conclusion Emotional reactions triggered by life events are responsible for full therapy agendas and for the rush in emergency rooms and hospitals. The reflex when faced with crying, insomnia or suicidal thoughts to give a diagnostic of major depressive disorder s is generally accepted by everyone. The elevated risk to commit suicide and the approved success of remission or healing through treatment (psychotherapy) are two major reasons why several studies promote the importance and the need to identify the adjustment disorder of our patients.},

The Prenatal Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (PreOCS; Lord, Rieder, Hall, Soares, \& Steiner, 2011) is the only self-report questionnaire that evaluates the severity and interference of specific pregnancy-related obsessions and compulsions. We aimed to analyze the validity and reliability of the PreOCS Portuguese version and to describe the prevalence, content, severity, interference, and onset of OC symptoms in pregnancy. Three hundred fifty-five pregnant women completed the PreOCS and other self-report instruments to evaluate perinatal anxiety and depression. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a second-order model presented an acceptable fit. Cronbach's alphas were {$\geq$}.75 for the Severity and the Interference subscales and both were moderately correlated with depression and anxiety measures. Nearly 10\% of the women presented OC symptoms with relevant severity. Co-occurrence of obsessions and compulsions (44.4\%) was associated with significantly higher PreOCS scores. Obsessions about contamination, harm to the baby, others' judgment and baby's health presented the highest prevalence and increased the odds of having at least one compulsion. Searching for information, asking for reassurance, checking, and cleaning were the most reported compulsions. The Portuguese version of PreOCS has good psychometric properties, presenting itself as a valid and reliable instrument.},

Childbirth of primiparous women is sometimes associated with severe pain that could predispose mothers to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms. Objective To assess the prevalence of postpartum depression among primiparous women, to determine risk factors that can contribute to this psychiatric disorder and to study the links between labor pain and postpartum depression. Methods To that end, we conducted a prospective and longitudinal study, including 183 primiparous women. In the first step, corresponding to the first 48hours after delivery, we assessed pain experienced during childbirth using the ``Saint-Antoine Pain Questionnaire''. In the second phase, 6 to 8 weeks after delivery, we used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results The average total score on the ``Saint-Antoine Pain Questionnaire'' was 74.44, with an average score of 45.01 for sensory pain and that of 29.44 for emotional pain. A depressive state was diagnosed in 18.7\% of mothers. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were significantly higher among primiparous women in case of an unwanted pregnancy, vaginal delivery, instrumental delivery, complicated childbirth and when the marital relationship was considered to be conflictual. An anxiety state was objectified in 20\% of women. Significantly higher anxiety scores were found in single mothers, those with a low socioeconomic level, those with a low level of education, in case of a vaginal delivery, when the sex of the baby was unwanted and when the quality of the marital bond and the contact with the healthcare team were judged to be of poor quality. Higher childbirth pain scores were associated with significantly higher scores of depression and anxiety. Moreover, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were significantly higher in primiparous mothers with higher scores of anxiety (P\textexclamdown 0.001). Conclusion It seems judicious to assess the childbirth pain, to improve its management by support strategies and to make health professionals aware of postpartum anxiety and depression disorders.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social communication impairments with restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). The increase in prevalence of ASD and the heterogeneity of symptom severity may arise from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors that alter synaptic plasticity. Maternal stress during pregnancy, which is linked to depression, may be one risk factor for an ASD phenotype in offspring. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment can be effective in alleviating maternal depression but prenatal SSRI exposure itself may be a risk factor for autism in offspring. The present study investigated in C57BL/6J pregnant mice whether restraint stress (G4\textendash 18) and/or treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine (G8\textendash 18) affects autism-related behaviors and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in male and female offspring. The findings indicate that restraint stress reduces preference for sucrose reward in pregnant dams that is reversed by fluoxetine. In adult male offspring, combined prenatal stress and SSRI exposure increased self-grooming and impaired spatial reversal learning. In adult female offspring, the prenatal experiences did not affect self-grooming, but restraint stress alone or SSRI exposure alone impaired spatial reversal learning. Prenatal stress reduced anxiety-related behavior in male and female offspring. Further, LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation of Schaffer-commissural afferents in field CA1 was significantly reduced in female offspring exposed to prenatal stress alone or combination with fluoxetine. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to prenatal stress, SSRI treatment or the combination differentially affects male and female offspring in autism-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity.},

Twenty-four per cent of these women were judged to be notably ill in a psychiatric sense. This number is thought to be excessively high, although a control study is required to settle this, but in any case is in excess of the prevalence rate for psychiatric disorder in the East African population generally. Depressive reaction were the most common pattern of disturbance, and this is in keeping with the recent realization that depression is a frequent disorder in the rural African. Unfavourable social, economic and domestic patterns inherent in the present transition between traditional and urbanized patterns of life appear to be significant in precipitating many of these psychiatric disorders. If modern antenatal care is to play a complete role in preventing the hazards of pregnancy, it must take account of the traditional beliefs and anxieties of rural African women, and seek to deal with these as they arise.}

Women suffering from MDD during pregnancy use antidepressant medications, particularly Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). These drugs readily cross the placental barrier and impact the developing fetal brain. The present study assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to fluoxetine (FLX), an SSRI antidepressant drug, on corticosterone and behavioral responses to stress in female mice. In young females, prenatal FLX significantly elevated corticosterone response to continuous stress. In adults, prenatal FLX augmented corticosterone response to acute stress and suppressed the response to continuous stress. Additionally, prenatal FLX significantly augmented stress-induced increase in locomotion and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in adult, but not young mice. The dexamethasone suppression test revealed that prenatal FLX induced a state of glucocorticoid resistance in adult females, indicating that the negative feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress was disrupted. These findings provide the first indication of altered hormonal and behavioral responses to continuous stress and suggest a role for the development of glucocorticoid resistance in these effects. According to these findings, prenatal environment may have implications for stress sensitivity and responsiveness to life challenges. Furthermore, this study may assist in understanding the limitations and precautions that should be taken in the use of SSRIs during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Pregnancy and postpartum are vulnerable periods for mental health problems and distress. Studies conducted worldwide have highlighted the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in adding to the rates of depression and anxiety in the perinatal period. However, there are very few reports on mothers who were identified as having COVID-19 infection at the time of childbirth. OBJECTIVE Our study aimed to find the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pregnant women who were admitted for labor and tested positive for COVID-19 infection. We also aimed to study the association of various sociodemographic, social support, and obstetrical factors and that of COVID-19-related worries with depression and anxiety. STUDY DESIGN The study was conducted at the obstetrics inpatient setting in a public hospital in New Delhi, which had a separate designated COVID-19 block. Pregnant and postpartum women \textquestiondown 18 years of age who were admitted to the COVID-19 maternity ward for delivery were included for this study. The women were interviewed within the first week of admission and after 6 to 8 weeks of childbirth. The sociodemographic and obstetrical details and COVID-19-related worries and concerns were assessed. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire version 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, respectively. The normally distributed variables are expressed as mean{$\pm$}standard deviation and continuous variables with skewed distribution as median (interquartile range). The categorical data presented as proportions of categorical variables were compared using the chi-square or the Fischer exact test. All the tests are 2-sided, with a significance level of 5\%. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 24. The rates of depression and anxiety were calculated and univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with moderate and severe anxiety and depression using various sociodemographic and obstetrical variables, the total COVID anxiety scale scores, and the social support score. RESULTS The mean age of the women was 26.86 years ({$\pm$}4.31). Of the 243 women assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire version 9, 168 (69.13\%) had mild depressive disorder, and 29 (11.3\%) had moderate depressive disorder. Of the 187 women who were assessed at the 6-weeks follow-up, 31 (16.57\%) had minimal depression, 131 (70.05\%) had mild depression, and 25 (13.36\%) had moderate depression. Mild anxiety was seen in 121 cases (49.79\%) and 13 (5.34\%) had moderate anxiety symptoms. Women reported several worries, especially about the stigma of COVID-19 infection, support for infant care, and access to infant health services. CONCLUSION Screening for common mental illnesses with the timely identification of associated risk factors should be done, with a liaison between obstetricians and mental health professionals. Obstetricians can address and reassure pregnant women regarding concerns about contracting the infection, worries about the possible effects of COVID-19 on the fetus and the newborn, and concerns about future consultations. In case the worries are out of proportion and necessitate intervention by mental health professionals, referral services should be made available. Hence, identifying and addressing the mental health concerns will help provide the optimum perinatal care during the pandemic.},

C'est un trouble aussi fr\'equemment m\'econnu, en raison notamment de la variation de son tableau clinique en fonction de l'\^age. Les auteurs rapportent ici l'observation d'une petite fille qui, \`a l'\^age de 9 ans, a d\'evelopp\'e un tableau clinique typique de schizophr\'enie, \`a d\'ebut brutal. \`A partir de cette observation, plusieurs points sont discut\'es au vu des donn\'ees de la litt\'erature : l'importance des alt\'erations retrouv\'ees dans l'histoire pr\'emorbide des enfants schizophr\`enes, l'importance des facteurs de vuln\'erabilit\'e g\'en\'etiques et des facteurs de stress pr\'ecoces dans le d\'eterminisme des troubles observ\'es, les difficult\'es li\'ees au traitement de ces formes \`a d\'ebut pr\'ecoce, enfin leur devenir, souvent p\'ejoratif, notamment en termes d'adaptation psychosociale.

Summary Childhood-onset schizophrenia is rare : its prevalence is about 50 times lower than the one observed in adulthood. It is also frequently unrecognized, notably because its clinical aspect varies with age. The authors report the case of a prepubertal girl who developed a typical clinical picture of schizophrenia (paranoid subtype) by age 9. Case report The patient was 10 years old when she was hospitalized for a relapse of a suspected childhood-onset schizophrenia. Several significant mental disorders were found in her family history : her mother was treated for mood disorders (including dysthymia and major depression with postpartum onset), while her father and a aunt exhibited schizophrenic disorders. In addition, prenatal and perinatal events (including probable prenatal maternal infection and obstetric complications) were reported by her mother. Demonstrable impairments were already present in her premorbid development : from the age of 3.5, she showed significant manifestations of behavioural inhibition and separation anxiety, severe difficulties in social adaptation, and language abnormalities (qualified by her general practitioner as selective mutism). At the age of 9, when her mother was hospitalized for a diabetes mellitus, she suddenly showed auditory and visual hallucinations associated with delusions. Their content included filiation, somatic, and persecutory themes. Grossly disorganized behaviour (and more particularly catatonic motor behaviours including catatonic rigidity and negativism and bizarre postures) was also observed. Negative symptoms (eg anhedonia, affective flattening, and alogia) were noted. Her IQ scores were 74 in the verbal subtests and 53 in the performance subtests. Because the diagnostic of childhood-onset schizophrenia was suspected, a neuroleptic treatment, haloperidol 3 mg/day, was tried. After a partial remission during a few months period (characterized by a decrease in delusions, anxiety and sleep difficulties), she showed a relapse leading to her hospitalization. At the time of her admission, she showed severe manifestations of separation anxiety including agitation, anger, crying, and insomnia, for which she received a short-lived treatment by lorazepam. When sedation was obtained, the clinical picture proved similar to the one previously observed : hallucinations, delusions, grossly disorganized behaviour, and thought disorder were noted. As soon as the diagnostic of childhood-onset schizophrenia was confirmed, she was administered a new antipsychotic agent, amisulpride, at dose of 600 mg/day. This treatment was going on during several weeks with no significant clinical effect. Because the early onset of the disorder, the family history of schizophrenia, and the lack of effectiveness of the two previously administered antipsychotic agents, a treatment with clozapine was started at the dose of 12,5 mg/day. From the outset of this treatment, clinically significant reductions in hallucinations and disorganized behaviours were noted. Dose was then progressively increased until 200 mg/day, resulting in significant improvement in cognitive and motor functionning. The patient is now in an educational institute. Her adaptation is considered satisfactory, in spite of regular exacerbations of delusions in response to stressful life events. Treatment with clozapine is going on, without any significant undesirable clinical effects. Discussion If an abrupt onset is rarely observed in prepubertal children, all the authors report that patients with very early onset schizophrenia show to have demonstrable impairments in their premorbid language as well as in their motor and social development. In addition, several studies suggest that more pronounced early developmental abnormalities are usually associated with a poor outcome in schizophrenia. The clinical picture also agrees with recent studies showing that in children paranoid subtype is as frequent as seen in adult disorders. If genetic factors play a significant role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, the notion that such factors may be more salient in very early onset and more severe cases is now usually accepted. However, a number of environmental factors, including prenatal maternal infections and perinatal complications, may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, in addition to genetic factors. Because a significant relationship between stressful life events and exacerbations in positive symptoms was found in the case reported, the authors examine the role of such stress factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and in the course of illness. A brief review of studies that have examined the effects of antipsychotic agents in children with schizophrenia underscores the paucity of data available to guide clinicians in this area. However, these data suggest that children who receive conventional neuroleptics experience significant adverse effects, primarily sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, they suggest that new antipsychotic agents, such as clozapine, may be more effective than conventional neuroleptics, particularly in negative symptoms. Lastly, the authors emphasize the poor outcome usually reported in childhood-onset schizophrenia, highlighting the need of a long-term pharmacological and behavioural treatment. Conclusion This case report, such as others, supports the hypothesis that there is a clinical continuity between early and later onset schizophrenia. It also suggests that very early onset schizophrenia is a more severe form of the disorder and may be secondary to greater familial vulnerability. Consequently, systematic studies of these patients may be particularly informative and may provide important informations for understanding the etiologic processes involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.},

The consequences, both for the women themselves and for their children, can be considerable and last for many years. This study focuses on the economic consequences, aiming to estimate the total costs and health-related quality of life losses over the lifetime of mothers and their children. Method A pathway or decision modelling approach was employed, based on data from previous studies. Systematic and pragmatic literature reviews were conducted to identify evidence of impacts of perinatal anxiety and depression on mothers and their children. Results The present value of total lifetime costs of perinatal depression (anxiety) was \textsterling 75,728 (\textsterling 34,811) per woman with condition. If prevalence estimates were applied the respective cost of perinatal anxiety and depression combined was about \textsterling 8500 per woman giving birth; for the United Kingdom, the aggregated costs were \textsterling 6.6 billion. The majority of the costs related to adverse impacts on children and almost a fifth were borne by the public sector. Limitations The method was exploratory in nature, based on a diverse range of literature and encountered important data gaps. Conclusions Findings suggest the need to allocate more resources to support women with perinatal mental illness. More research is required to understand the type of interventions that can reduce long-term negative effects for both mothers and offspring.},

Methods Observational study, in a French Tertiary Maternity. Population: 25 women in a subsequent pregnancy after a medical termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality, 18-year-old and older. Prenatal Interviews at 20 Gestationnal weeks (GW), 27 GW and 35 GW and Postnatal at 3 months and at each time self-administered questionnaires of anxiety, post-traumatic stress syndrome (PCLS) depressive symptoms (EPDS), prenatal attachment (PAI) and Perinatal Grief Scale (PGS). Results Pregnancy onset, i.e. before 20 GW, showed increased prevalence of anxiety (16/23, 66.7\%), depression (7/23, 30.4\%) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (4/16, 25\%). Total score on PGS is higher in onset of pregnancy than in the third trimester (p = 0.005). Prenatal attachment was lower during early pregnancy (p = 0.003) and correlated inversely with grief intensity (p = 0.022). During late pregnancy, emotional symptoms decrease, and prenatal attachment stopped increase positively, specifically among women whose foetal abnormality in previous pregnancies were diagnosed late, at an average of 25 GW. Conclusion This research shows the specific dynamics of pregnancies following TOP and highlights the necessity for early prenatal psychological support.

The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1\% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4\% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95\% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7\% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95\% CI 3.4, 3.9). Conclusions In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls.},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have shown an association between prepregnancy BMI and postpartum depression, but little is known about this association beyond one year postpartum and the influence of postpartum weight retention (PPWR). Methods We used data from 70355 mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort to estimate the associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and PPWR, respectively, and incident depression/anxiety disorders until six years postpartum. Outcome was depression or anxiety diagnosed clinically or filling a prescription for an antidepressant. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Follow-up started at the day of delivery. For the analysis regarding PPWR, follow-up started six months postpartum. Results Underweight, overweight and obesity were associated with depression and/or anxiety disorders when compared to normal-weight, though the associations were attenuated after adjustments (HR 1.24 [95\% CI 1.06\textendash 1.45], 1.05 [95\% CI 0.96\textendash 1.15] and 1.07 [95\% CI 0.95\textendash 1.21] for underweight, overweight and obese, respectively). Compared to mothers who had returned to their prepregnancy BMI, risk of depression/anxiety disorders was increased for mothers, who from prepregnancy to 6 months postpartum experienced either weight loss \textquestiondown 1 BMI unit (HR 1.19 [95\% CI 1.06\textendash 1.25]), weight gain of 2\textendash 3 BMI units (HR 1.23 [95\% CI 1.08\textendash 1.40]), or weight gain of {$\geq$}3 BMI units (HR 1.21 [95\% CI 1.05\textendash 1.40]). Limitation Causal direction and mechanisms behind the associations are largely unknown. Conclusions Low prepregnancy body weight and postpartum weight gain or loss are associated with occurrence of depression and anxiety disorders.},

  abstract = {Background One in 5 recently deployed US women veterans report overactive bladder symptoms. Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety commonly co-occur in women with overactive bladder, but temporal relationships between these outcomes have not been well studied, and the mechanism behind this association is unknown. The Women Veterans Urinary Health Study, a nationwide longitudinal study in recently deployed women veterans, was designed to better understand relationships between overactive bladder and mental health conditions. Objective We sought to estimate the 1-year incidence and remission of overactive bladder and to identify the impact of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and prior sexual assault on 1-year overactive bladder incidence and remission rates. Study Design Participants of this 1-year prospective cohort study were female veterans separated from military service who had returned from Iraq or Afghanistan deployment within the previous 2 years. Eligible women were identified through the Defense Manpower Data Center and recruited by mail and telephone. Telephone screening confirmed participants were ambulatory, community-dwelling veterans and excluded those with urinary tract fistula, congenital abnormality, or cancer; pelvic radiation; spinal cord injury; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson disease; stroke; or current/recent pregnancy. Data collection included computer-assisted telephone interviews performed at enrollment and 1 year later. The interview assessed demographic and military service characteristics; urinary symptoms and treatment; depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and treatment; and a lifetime history of sexual assault. Overactive bladder was identified if at least moderately bothersome urgency urinary incontinence and/or urinary frequency symptoms were reported on Urogenital Distress Inventory items. Exposures included depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and lifetime sexual assault, assessed at baseline using validated questionnaires (including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist). Associations between exposures and overactive bladder incidence and remission were estimated using propensity score adjusted logistic regression models. Results In all, 1107 (88.0\%) of 1258 eligible participants completed 1-year interviews. Median age was 29 (range 20-67) years and 53\% were nulliparous. Overactive bladder was identified at baseline in 242 (22\%), and 102 (9.2\%), 218 (19.7\%), 188 (17.0\%), and 287 (25.9\%) met criteria for baseline depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and lifetime sexual assault, respectively. At 1 year, overactive bladder incidence was 10.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 8.6\textendash 12.8\%), and remission of overactive bladder was 36.9\% (95\% confidence interval, 30.8\textendash 43.4\%). New overactive bladder occurred more often in women with baseline anxiety (21\% vs 9\%), posttraumatic stress disorder (19\% vs 9\%) and lifetime sexual assault (16\% vs 9\%) (all: P \textexclamdown{} .01). After adjustment, anxiety (odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.4\textendash 4.1) and lifetime sexual assault (odds ratio, 1.7; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0\textendash 2.8) predicted 1-year incident overactive bladder. Overactive bladder remission occurred less often in those with baseline depression (19\% vs 41\%, P \textexclamdown{} .01) and anxiety (29\% vs 42\%, P = .03). After adjustment, depression decreased 1-year overactive bladder remission risk (odds ratio, 0.37; 95\% confidence interval, 0.16\textendash 0.83). Overactive bladder treatment was uncommon and not associated with remission. Conclusion Anxiety, depression, and prior sexual assault\textendash common postdeployment problems for women veterans\textendash influence the natural history of overactive bladder. Providers should screen for mental health conditions and sexual assault in women with newly diagnosed or persistent overactive bladder.},

  abstract = {Background As mental healthcare expands to web-apps, smartphones, and other technologies, it is important to understand the psychological profiles of women who self-select to participate in perinatal mental health digital platform randomized control trials. There are concerns that those seeking internet-based mental health treatments may not be representative of the general perinatal populations seeking face-to-face treatments resulting in a lack of generalizability. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic and psychological profiles of prenatal women seeking treatment over the internet for mental health concerns as compared to the general perinatal population seeking mental health treatments. Methods This was a descriptive study involving pregnant women across Alberta, Canada, aged 18\textendash 47 years old. Profiles were collected through self-report baseline demographics and mental health information using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Antenatal Risk Questionnaire (ANRQ), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)- Anxiety and Stress Subscales, and Maclean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD). Results A total of 887 women completed self-reported baseline demographic data and 590 women completed baseline mental health data. Mean age of women was 31.3 years with a mean pregnancy gestational age of 15.3 weeks). A history of depression was reported by 36.3\%, a history of anxiety was reported by 20.8\% of women, and a history of abuse and emotional abuse was reported in 27.7\% and 23.5\% of women. At baseline, 57.6\% of women had clinically significant mental health risk scores, 24.3\% of women had probable minor depression, and mild to moderate levels of anxiety were reported in 23.2\% of women. Borderline personality disorder was reported by 12.5\% of women. Conclusions Overall, this sample of pregnant women has prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress that are comparable to those rates found in pregnant women in the general population. This suggests that there is broad utility for and consumer interest in internet-based mental health treatments.},

Results are inconsistent as to whether the effect of grandparental depression on child problem behaviour is independent of parental psychopathology. Methods Mothers and their children participated in an ethnically Dutch subcohort of a population-based prospective cohort in the Netherlands. N=816 (66\%) mothers and n=691 fathers participated in the prenatal interviews. N=687 (84\%) mothers and children and n=565 (82\%) fathers participated three years postpartum. (Grand)parental psychopathology was assessed during pregnancy of the mothers with the Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Child behaviour was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by mother and father when the child was three years old. Results Grandparental anxiety disorder predicted maternal reports of children's internalizing problems (OR=1.98, 95\% C.I.

However, grandparental psychopathology was not associated with children's problem behaviour as reported by the father. Limitations Information on grandparental lifetime psychiatric disorder was assessed through a parental interview which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence rates. Conclusions These results confirm the importance of a family history including not only the parental but also the grandparental generations.},

Objectives The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of the post-partum post-traumatic stress disorder (PP-PTSD) in primiparous women, and to determine the profile of women at risk of developing this disorder. Methods We conducted a descriptive, prospective and longitudinal study carried out at the maternity department of the Hedi Chaker Hospital, Sfax-Tunisia over a period of 15 months. At the first stage of the study, the Saint-Antoine pain questionnaire, the peri-traumatic dissociative experiences questionnaire and the peri-traumatic distress inventory were used respectively to assess the pain of delivery, the peri-traumatic dissociation and distress. At the second stage of the study, the questionnaires, perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder (PPQ), hospital anxiety and depression scale and the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale were used respectively for the PP-PTSD screening and the assessment of the post-partum anxious and depressive symptomatology. Results The study population consisted of 183 parturients at the first stage of the study and 150 parturients at the second stage of the study. The incidence of the PP-PTSD was 9.3 \%. In the multivariate study, some factors studied were significantly associated with the development of PTSD-PP, including a history of therapeutic termination of pregnancy, a history of miscarriage, exposure to a stressful event during pregnancy, prenatal hospitalization of the mother, instrumental delivery, pain intensity especially in the affective component, peri-traumatic dissociation and avoidance of sexual intercourse for fear of a new pregnancy. However the skin to skin contact with the new-born immediately after delivery was a significant protective factor. Conclusion The psychological consequences associated with the first birth, particularly the PP-PTSD, are common. The Identification of women at risk and a systematic screening of postpartum post-traumatic stress symptoms are desirable.},

For those women who have had a previous unsuccessful outcome, pregnancy may bring a lot of inevitable negative emotions. We studied psychiatric morbidity during second trimester of pregnancy subsequent to abortion in the previous pregnancy. Methods The study was carried out in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India. A total of 120 patients were divided into 4 groups depending on their pregnancy status. All the groups were compared with each other regarding their psychiatric morbidities, which were measured using various rating scales such as Hamilton Depression rating scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Presumptive Stressful Life events Scale, and Brief Psychotic Rating Scale. Results We found that subjects with history of previous abortion, whether single or more had significantly higher mean depression and anxiety score than primigravida or subjects with history of previous successful pregnancy; depression and anxiety scores decreased with increase in time gap between abortion and current pregnancy. High anxiety was found in 36.67\%(11) of females with history of previous abortion. We also found that 36.67\%(11) of subjects with previous single abortion and 30\%(9) of subjects with previous 2 or more abortions were suffering from depressive episode. None of the female suffered from psychotic disorder. Conclusions The incidence of depression and anxiety is high in pregnancy after previous abortion and more in subjects who conceive earlier after previous abortion. These results warrant the need for screening all pregnancies for psychiatric morbidity after a previous abortion.},

  abstract = {Background Recent evidence suggests that prenatal maternal distress increases the risk of allergic diseases in offspring. However, the effect of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety on atopic dermatitis (AD) risk remains poorly understood. Objective We investigated whether prenatal maternal distress is associated with AD risk in offspring and whether the mechanism is mediated by reactive oxygen species. Methods Two general population-based birth cohorts formed the study. One cohort (Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and Allergic Diseases [COCOA]) consisted of 973 mother-baby dyads, and the other (Panel Study on Korean Children [PSKC]) consisted of 1531 mother-baby dyads. The association between prenatal distress and AD was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models. In COCOA placental 11{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 and glutathione levels and serum IgE levels in 1-year-old children were measured. Results In COCOA and PSKC AD occurred in 30.6\% (lifetime prevalence) and 11.6\% (1 year prevalence) of offspring, respectively. Prenatal maternal distress increased the risk of AD in offspring, both in COCOA (hazard ratio for depression, 1.31 [95\% CI, 1.02-1.69]; hazard ratio for anxiety, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.06-1.89]) and PSKC (odds ratio for distress, 1.85 [95\% CI, 1.06-3.25]). In COCOA both prenatal maternal depression and anxiety scores were positively related to the predicted probability of AD (P \textexclamdown{} .001 in both). Prenatal distress decreased placental glutathione to glutathione disulfide ratios (P = .037) and, especially in those who later had AD, decreased placental 11{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 levels (P = .010) and increased IgE levels at 1 year of age (P = .005). Conclusion Prenatal maternal depression and anxiety promote risk of AD in offspring. Maternal distress increases the predicted probability of AD. The mechanism might involve chronic stress, abnormal steroid levels, and reactive oxygen species.},

Physical activity was measured in metabolic equivalents. Findings the physically active women experienced fewer depressive symptoms and estimated an improved quality of life during their pregnancies as measured by physical functioning, bodily pain, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and general mental health as compared with the physically inactive women. There were no differences between the groups in gestational weight gain or weight change from early pregnancy to post partum or in prevalence of complications.

We aimed to analyze the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression in the 1993 birth cohort (Pelotas, Brazil). Methods Data on maternal smoking were collected in the perinatal study, while information on GAD and depression was collected at age 22 years using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Information on maternal mental health, the mediator, was collected at the 11-year follow-up. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess the association between exposure, outcomes, and analysis of negative controls. Results 3,781 participants presented complete data. The incidence of GAD was 10.4\%, depression 2.9\%, and smoking during pregnancy 32.6\%. The children of mothers who smoked had a 45\% higher chance of developing GAD at age 22 years (OR 1.45; 95\%CI 1.18; 1.80) and 75\% higher chance of depression (OR 1.75; 95\%CI 1.18; 2.59). Also, the higher the number of cigarettes smoked. the higher was the chance for the development of GAD. Paternal smoking was not associated with the outcomes. The mother's mental health accounted for 18.2\% of the association between maternal smoking and GAD, and for 13.4\% for maternal smoking and depression. Limitations Data for smoking during pregnancy were collected through a self-report. Residual confusion due to important variables cannot be ruled out. Conclusions MSDP was associated with the mental health of children in early adulthood. However, a small part of the effect found was mediated by the mother's mental health.},

Setting Paper and pencil questionnaires once during pregnancy and twice in the first 6 months postpartum. Participants 123 women recruited from a national support group for mothers of twins. Main Outcome Measures Mothers' Information Tool, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Index of Breastfeeding Status. Results 110 (89.4\%) of the sample initiated breastfeeding or initiated a milk supply by pumping. Percentage of breast milk feedings at time 2 predicted whether or not a woman was still breastfeeding at time 3 (odds ratio = 3.63, p \textexclamdown{} .001). Conclusion A high percentage of breastfeeding initiation was found despite the increased care burden that has been described for mothers of twins. Mothers who continued to breastfeed at time 3 provided a high percentage of the twins' milk feedings as breast milk. The results suggest that mothers who are able to persist with the difficulties of establishing a milk supply for twins and feeding two infants are able to continue providing a high percentage of the infants' feedings as breast milk.},

  abstract = {Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of mental health (MH) disorders including antenatal and postnatal depression (PND), anxiety and post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized GDM and MH disorders will disproportionately affect individuals from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds. Methods A systematic methodology was developed, and a protocol was published in PROSPERO (CRD42020210863) and a systematic review of publications between 1st January 1990 and 30th January 2021 was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were explored using keywords and MeSH terms. The finalised dataset was analysed using statistical methods such as random-effect models, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. These were used to determine odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) to establish prevalence using variables of PND, anxiety, PTSD and stress to name a few. Findings Sixty studies were finalised from the 20,040 data pool. Forty-six studies were included systematically with 14 used to meta-analyze GDM and MH outcomes. A second meta-analysis was conducted using 7 studies to determine GDM risk among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic women with pre-existing MH disorders. The results indicate an increased risk with pooled adjusted OR for both reflected at 1.23, 95\% CI of 1.00\textendash 1.50 and 1.29, 95\% CI of 1.11\textendash 1.50 respectively. Interpretation The available studies suggest a MH sequalae with GDM as well as a sequalae of GDM with MH among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic populations. Our findings warrant further future exploration to better manage these patients. Funding Not applicable},

Methods In a population-based cohort in a health region near Vancouver, Canada, 522 mothers completed a mailed questionnaire at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum measuring socio-demographic, biological, pregnancy-related, life stressor, social support, obstetric, and maternal adjustment factors. We undertook a sequential logistic regression analysis to develop a multifactorial predictive model of sustained postpartum anxiety, as measured by a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score \textquestiondown 40 at 1 week and/or 4 weeks, and 8 weeks postpartum. Results The prevalence of sustained postpartum anxiety was 12.6\% (95\% CI 9.6\textendash 16.2). In the multivariable model, predictors of sustained anxiety in the postpartum period were perceived stress at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 3.74, 95\% CI 2.17-6.44) and partner social support at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.40\textendash 0.85). Depression symptomatology at 1 week, child care stress, and maternal self-esteem were non-significant. Limitations Single women and women from ethnic minority backgrounds were underrepresented in the sample. Conclusions A large proportion of women experience sustained postpartum anxiety. High perceived stress and low partner social support can be used to facilitate early identification of women likely to experience persistent anxiety in the postpartum period and suggest the need for urgent access to psychotherapeutic services for these women. These factors may also be potential targets for individual or couples therapy to treat postpartum anxiety.},

Design: A longitudinal population-based study in which participants completed psychosocial measures of depression, anxiety and PTSD in pregnancy (n = 950), 4-6 weeks (n = 858) and 6 months (n = 829) after birth. Setting: A consecutive sample of pregnant women were recruited from three maternity hospitals in three cities of Turkey: Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Measures: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) were used to assess depression, anxiety and PTSD, respectively. Findings: Depression and PTSD peaked at 4-6 weeks postpartum and then fell at 6 months postpartum, whereas anxiety followed a gradually declining linear-pattern from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The prevalence of depression was 14.6\% in pregnancy, 32.6\% at 4-6 weeks and 18.5\% at 6 months postpartum, respectively. The prevalence of PTSD was 5.8\% in pregnancy, 11.9\% at 4-6 weeks postpartum and 9.2\% at 6 months postpartum. Anxiety was highest in pregnancy (29.6\%) and then decreased to 24.6\% 4-6 weeks after birth and to 16.2\% 6 months after birth. New-onset cases were most apparent at 4-6 weeks postpartum: 24.6\% for depression; 13.7\% for anxiety and 8.9\% for PTSD. Key conclusions: A relatively high prevalence of psychological disorders was identified during the perinatal period. Anxiety was most prevalent in pregnancy, and depression and PTSD were highest at 4-6 weeks postpartum. Depression was more common than anxiety 4-6 weeks and 6 months after birth and highly comorbid with anxiety throughout this period. New-onset cases were observed at both 4-6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Implications: High rates of affective disorders in pregnancy and after birth highlight three main points: first, it is important to have effective perinatal screening to identify women with psychological needs; second, providing early treatment to women experiencing severe psychological problems is essential to ensure psychological well-being of those women and to prevent chronicity; and finally, psychosocial screening and interventions should be offered until at least 6 months after birth to catch new-onset cases.},

It has been proposed that environmental stress during pregnancy may affect the neurodevelopment of the foetus and lead to a vulnerability in the child to later stressors and psychopathology. Aim In this study we explore the relationship between environmental stress during pregnancy and psychotic experiences in children in the general population at 12years. Methods We analysed a birth cohort of 5038 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Environmental stress was measured as life event exposure. Data on life events were collected on women during their pregnancy, whilst psychotic experiences in the offspring were assessed at age 12. Results There was a weak association between maternal exposure to life events and psychotic experiences at twelve years (crude OR 1.10 95\% CI 1.02\textendash 1.18) per quartile of life event score. This association was not reduced after adjustment for socio-economic status, family history of schizophrenia, maternal education or birth weight but after adjustment for maternal anxiety and depression and smoking in early pregnancy there was no longer any evidence for an association (OR 1.01 95\% CI 0.93\textendash 1.10). Conclusion This study provides some evidence to suggest that stressful life events may affect child psychotic experiences through effects on maternal psychopathology, and possibly physiology, during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Pregnancy is a very complex and highly stressful time in which women become more physically and emotionally vulnerable. Therefore, mothers are more likely to face decreased self-esteem and increased postpartum depression. Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, more than 50 \% of mothers are undiagnosed or untreated, showing an urgent need to explore an effective preventive strategy. A healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity have been suggested to be associated with an increased quality of life in pregnant and postpartum women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether swimming exercise before and during pregnancy can affect maternal care and postpartum depression-related behaviors in dams. To this end, female NMRI and C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to swimming exercise before conception and throughout pregnancy. On postpartum days 1\textendash 2, maternal behavior including nest building, active nursing, and licking/grooming were monitored. A battery of behavioral tests was also used to measure depression-related symptoms including anhedonia- and anxiety-like behavior, social behavior, and behavioral despair. To identify the underlying mechanisms, corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines during late pregnancy, and corticosterone and brain serotonin during the postpartum period were measured in dams. The findings indicated that swimming exercise increased gestational corticosterone, decreased maternal care and brain serotonin, and increased all depression-related behaviors in postpartum C57BL/6 J dams, while only increased licking/grooming and social behavior, and reduced anhedonia-like behavior in postpartum NMRI dams. Taken together, this study suggests that swimming exercise before and during pregnancy could alter maternal care and postpartum depression-like behavior in a strain-dependent manner.},

The current research represents the first study of maternal postpartum AD prevalence in which all of the AD are assessed, and one of few studies of this type in which maternal prenatal AD incidence is assessed. Methods A Canadian sample of pregnant women (N=310) was recruited from a defined geographical area between November 2007 and November 2010. Participants were first administered postnatal mood and anxiety screening measures. Those who scored at or above cutoff on one or more of these measures were administered a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety at approximately three months postpartum (n=115). Findings from the diagnostic interview were used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of mood and AD in pregnancy, as well as at and during the first three months postpartum. Period prevalence and incidence estimates were obtained retrospectively from interview data collected postnatally. Results The prevalence of AD during pregnancy and the early postpartum period (15.8\% and 17.1\% respectively) exceeded that of depression (3.9\% and 4.8\% respectively). The prevalence of OCD in our sample exceeded that of OCD among adults aged 18\textendash 64. Parity was unrelated to AD prevalence. Slightly less than 5\% of participants were comorbid for both AD, and depression. Limitations This study is limited by a relatively small sample size for a prevalence study, and non-random sample selection. As only women who scored above cutoff on one or more screening measures were interviewed, prevalence estimates are conservative. Finally, prenatal prevalence estimates are based on retrospective report provided postpartum. Conclusions This study provides evidence that, as a group, anxiety and related conditions affect a significant proportion of postpartum women, and are more prevalent than is postpartum depression.},

Previous studies have established links between miscarriage and early symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the incidence of posttraumatic stress symptoms and the psychologic response specifically to ectopic pregnancies have not been investigated. Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate levels of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety in women in the 9 months after early pregnancy loss, with a focus on miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Morbidity at 1 month was compared with a control group in healthy pregnancy. Study Design This was a prospective cohort study. Consecutive women were recruited from the early pregnancy and antenatal clinics at 3 London hospitals and received emailed surveys that contained standardized psychologic assessments that included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Posttraumatic stress Diagnostic Scale, at 1, 3, and 9 months after loss. Control subjects were assessed after a dating scan. We assessed the proportion of participants who met the screening criteria for posttraumatic stress and moderate/severe anxiety or depression. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Results Seven hundred thirty-seven of 1098 women (67\%) with early pregnancy loss (including 537 miscarriages and 116 ectopic pregnancies) and 171 of 187 control subjects (91\%) agreed to participate. Four hundred ninety-two of the women with losses (67\%) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale after 1 month; 426 women (58\%) completed it after 3 months, and 338 women (46\%) completed it after 9 months. Eighty-seven control subjects (51\%) participated. Criteria for posttraumatic stress were met in 29\% of women with early pregnancy loss after 1 month and in 18\% after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.80; 95\% confidence interval, 0.72\textendash 0.89). Moderate/severe anxiety was reported in 24\% after 1 month and in 17\% after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.69; 95\% confidence interval, 0.50\textendash 0.94). Moderate/severe depression was reported in 11\% of the women after 1 month and 6\% of the women after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.53\textendash 1.44). After miscarriage, proportions after 9 months were 16\% for posttraumatic stress, 17\% for anxiety, and 5\% for depression. Corresponding figures after ectopic pregnancy were 21\%, 23\%, and 11\%, respectively. In contrast, among control women with viable pregnancies, 13\% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety (odds ratio loss at 1 month vs controls: 2.14; 95\% confidence interval, 1.14\textendash 4.36), and 2\% reported moderate-to-severe depression (odds ratio loss at 1 month vs control subjects: 3.88; 95\% confidence interval, 1.27\textendash 19.2). Conclusion Women experience high levels of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression after early pregnancy loss. Distress declines over time but remains at clinically important levels at 9 months.},

Methods Sleep data from the 14-year (n = 4,924) and 21-year (n = 3660) follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort were used. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychological conditions were explored for their role in sleep problems. Modified Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used to identify predictors. Inverse probability weights were used to account for attrition. Results Of all subjects, 26.0\% of the subjects at 14 years and 28.3\% of the subjects at 21 years reported ``often'' sleep problems, with 41.7\% of adolescent sleep problems persisting at 21 years. Perinatal and early-life maternal factors, for example, drug abuse (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.71), smoking, depression, and anxiety, were significant predictors of adolescent sleep problems. Female sex (IRR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.55-2.94), advanced pubertal stages, and smoking were the important predictors of sleep problems at 21 years. Adolescent depression/anxiety supported the continuity of sleep problems (IRR, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.40), whereas exercise was seen to exert a protective effect. Conclusion This study indicates high rates of sleep problems in young subjects, with around half of sleep problems originating in adolescence persisting in young adulthood. Therefore, early interventions are needed to manage sleep problems in young subjects and prevent further progression to other life stages. Future studies should explore if sleep problems in young adults also persist in later life stages and identify the factors supporting the continuity of sleep problems.},

Estimates of postpartum depressive symptoms range from 6.5\% to 12.9\% and from 8.6\% to 9.9\% for postpartum anxiety. We sought to identify the role social support could play in mitigating PMADs. Methods The data are drawn from the Listening to Mothers in California survey; results are representative of women who gave birth in 2016 in a California hospital. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used to assess total symptoms of PMADs and anxiety and depressive symptoms individually. Two questions adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were used to assess emotional, practical, and functional (combined) social support. After exclusions for missing data related to PMADs or social support, we analyzed data from 2,372 women. Results At the time of survey administration (mean 5.7 months after birth), 7.0\% of respondents reported elevated PMAD symptoms and 45.9\% reported that they always received functional social support. In multivariable analysis, controlling for demographic and pregnancy-related factors and prenatal anxiety and depressive symptoms, women who reported consistent support had a prevalence of elevated PMAD symptoms one-half that of those who did not (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95\% confidence interval, 0.34\textendash 0.74). Conclusions This study suggests that consistent social support serves as a robust protective factor against postpartum symptoms of PMADs. Because many predictors of PMADs are not modifiable, social support stands out as an important target for programmatic intervention, particularly in light of increased isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.}

Results Among the 229 women interviewed the point prevalence of all psychiatric diagnosis was 19.2\% and the point prevalence of antenatal depression and anxiety disorders was 14.8\% and 4.4\%, respectively, at 18.6 weeks of gestation. At 36 weeks of gestation, the point prevalence of depressive disorder was 10\%. Two thirds of the antenatal depression remitted postpartum. Conclusion A significant proportion of Maltese women suffer from psychiatric morbidity during pregnancy. Depressive disorders are the commonest morbidity in this study population. Given the scope of the morbidity and potential impact on obstetric and neonatal outcomes, early detection and treatment are recommended.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Globally, a growing number of children and adolescents are left behind when parents migrate. We investigated the effect of parental migration on the health of left behind-children and adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, and Popline from inception to April 27, 2017, without language restrictions, for observational studies investigating the effects of parental migration on nutrition, mental health, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and abuse in left-behind children (aged 0\textendash 19 years) in LMICs. We excluded studies in which less than 50\% of participants were aged 0\textendash 19 years, the mean or median age of participants was more than 19 years, fewer than 50\% of parents had migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median duration of migration was less than 6 months. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted summary estimates from published reports independently. The main outcomes were risk and prevalence of health outcomes, including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional injuries, substance use, abuse, and infectious disease. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064871. Findings Our search identified 10 284 records, of which 111 studies were included for analysis, including a total of 264 967 children (n=106 167 left-behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and adolescents of non-migrant parents). 91 studies were done in China and focused on effects of internal labour migration. Compared with children of non-migrants, left-behind children had increased risk of depression and higher depression scores (RR 1{$\cdot$}52 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}27\textendash 1{$\cdot$}82]; SMD 0{$\cdot$}16 [0{$\cdot$}10\textendash 0{$\cdot$}21]), anxiety (RR 1{$\cdot$}85 [1{$\cdot$}36\textendash 2{$\cdot$}53]; SMD 0{$\cdot$}18 [0{$\cdot$}11\textendash 0{$\cdot$}26]), suicidal ideation (RR 1{$\cdot$}70 [1{$\cdot$}28\textendash 2{$\cdot$}26]), conduct disorder (SMD 0{$\cdot$}16 [0{$\cdot$}04\textendash 0{$\cdot$}28]), substance use (RR 1{$\cdot$}24 [1{$\cdot$}00\textendash 1{$\cdot$}52]), wasting (RR 1{$\cdot$}13 [1{$\cdot$}02\textendash 1{$\cdot$}24]) and stunting (RR 1{$\cdot$}12 [1{$\cdot$}00\textendash 1{$\cdot$}26]). No differences were identified between left-behind children and children of non-migrants for other nutrition outcomes, unintentional injury, abuse, or diarrhoea. No studies reported outcomes for other infectious diseases, self-harm, unprotected sex, or early pregnancy. Study quality varied across the included studies, with 43\% of studies at high or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains. Interpretation Parental migration is detrimental to the health of left-behind children and adolescents, with no evidence of any benefit. Policy makers and health-care professionals need to take action to improve the health of these young people. Funding Wellcome Trust.}

At the prenatal period the comorbid and depressed groups had higher scores than the other groups on the depression measure. But, the comorbid group had higher anxiety, anger and daily hassles scores than the other groups, and they had lower dopamine levels. As compared to the non-depressed group, they also reported more sleep disturbances and relationship problems. The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.},

This study aims to determine the prevalence rate of HPD within a population of women with SMI and to report on rates within different mental illness diagnoses and types of medication exposure. Study design A retrospective multicentre study of 521 pregnant women attending specialised antenatal clinics for the management of established SMI. Main outcome measures Measures included sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy complications, mental health diagnosis and psychotropic medication use. Results Overall, 14\% of women in the study had HDP. Compared to women with non-affective psychotic and other non-psychotic disorders (10.3\%), women with depression and anxiety disorders demonstrated an increased risk of having a diagnosis of HDP (18.8\%; RR = 1.82 [95\% CI: 1.01, 3.29], p = .048). Log-binomial regression demonstrated that both a BMI in the overweight and obese range (RR = 3.37 [95\% CI: 1.04, 10.95], p = .044) and continuous SNRI treatment throughout pregnancy (RR = 2.79 [95\% CI; 1.33, 5.83], p = .006) were significant predictors of HDP, after adjusting for maternal age, gestational diabetes, and other mental health diagnoses. Conclusion Women with severe mental illnesses have elevated risk of developing HPD. Management remains complex and should address their comorbid risk profiles, and weigh up the risks and benefits of psychotropic medication use, given these results provide evidence of elevated rates of HDP associated with exposure to SNRI when taken throughout pregnancy.},

The objective of our analysis was to estimate the prevalence, maternal characteristics, and geographic distribution of OUD at delivery hospitalization in Maine using recent state-level data. Study design Serially collected cross-sectional population-based data. Methods We used diagnosis and procedure codes to identify deliveries among hospital discharges in Maine, 2009\textendash 2018 (n = 120,764), and to categorize deliveries according to the prevalence of maternal OUD and selected conditions. We assessed linear trends in OUD at delivery and calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for co-occurring maternal conditions. Results The prevalence of maternal OUD per 1000 deliveries in Maine increased from 22.7 in 2009 to 34.9 in 2018 (linear trend P value \textexclamdown{} 0.01), with a mean annual increase of 1.6 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9 to 2.4).

Women with OUD at delivery were also more likely to reside in small rural areas (27.3\% vs 22.5\%) and deliver in a hospital with a level III nursery (50.6\% vs 34.9\%). Conclusions Maternal OUD now accounts for 1 in 29 deliveries in Maine and commonly occurs with other medical conditions.

Aim of the study Pregnancy can be seen as a higher vulnerability period. Prenatal depression is a common psychopathological complication among pregnant women. This study evaluates the presence of prenatal depressive features and its psychosocial correlates in a French sample. Patients and method One hundred and twenty-six pregnant women were assessed for depression (EPDS, Cox et al., 1987 [30]), anxiety (STAI-Y, Spielberger, 1983 [38]), psychological distress (GHQ-12, Goldberg, 1978 [36]) and perceived social support (SSQ6, Sarason et al., 1983 [40]). Results The high rate of prenatal depression in this French sample (19,8\%) is consistent with that found in the international literature. Young, single and low educated women appeared to be more vulnerable to prenatal depression. Anxiety, psychological distress and perceived social support were related to a great extend to depression. Conclusion Consistent with previous international studies, a vulnerability profile could be defined to potentially enable better screening in the course of prenatal care. The use of EPDS in its prenatal form ought to be encouraged in French population, in order to improve early recognition and treatment of depressive features and to avoid first mother-baby bonds troubles.},

  abstract = {Background Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden of preterm birth (PTB) and low infant birth weight (LBW) complications where affective and anxiety disorders are more common in the antepartum period than in industrialized countries. Objective To evaluate the extent to which early pregnancy antepartum depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery among a cohort of pregnant women in Peru. Methods Our prospective cohort study consisted of 4408 pregnant women. Antepartum depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD were assessed in early pregnancy using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and PTSD Checklist \textendash{} Civilian Version, respectively. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear and logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted measures of association ({$\beta$} coefficients and odds ratios) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Results After adjusting for confounders, women with antepartum generalized anxiety (32.6\% prevalence) had higher odds of LBW (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.47; 95\%CI: 1.10\textendash 1.95) and were more likely to deliver small for gestational age (OR = 1.39; 95\%CI: 1.01\textendash 1.92) infants compared to those without anxiety. Compared to those without PTSD, women with PTSD (34.5\%) had higher odds of delivering preterm (OR = 1.28; 95\%CI: 1.00\textendash 1.65) yet PTSD was not associated with LBW nor gestational age at delivery. Women with antepartum depression (26.2\%) were at no increased risk of delivering a preterm, low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant. Limitations Our ability to make casual inferences from this observational study is limited; however, these findings are consistent with prior studies. Conclusion Generalized anxiety disorder during pregnancy appeared to increase odds of delivering a low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant, while PTSD was associated with increased odds of delivering preterm. Our findings, and those of others, suggest antenatal care should be tailored to screen for and provide additional mental health services to patients.},

Data Sources Electronic databases Cochrane, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and PubMed were searched. Manual searches of reference lists supplemented the electronic search. Study Selection Peer-reviewed articles written in English on the role of posttraumatic stress disorder during the perinatal period were included. Data Extraction Key findings relevant to perinatal posttraumatic stress that were reported in primary sources and meta-analyses were organized according to themes, including The Role of Childbirth, Comorbidity With Depression and Anxiety, Risk Factors for Perinatal PTSD, High-Risk Health Behaviors, and Association With Adverse Health Outcomes. Data Synthesis Across studies, antenatal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates were estimated between 2.3\% and 24\%, and observed prevalence rates during the postnatal period ranged from 1\% to 20\%; however, many researchers failed to assess PTSD that existed before or during pregnancy, and when preexisting PTSD is a controlled variable, postpartum rates drop to 2\% to 4.7\%. In addition to prenatal depression and anxiety and pre-pregnancy history of psychiatric disorders, history of sexual trauma, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and psychosocial attributes are risk factors for development or exacerbation of perinatal PTSD. Conclusion Women's health care providers should evaluate for PTSD in routine mental health assessments during and after pregnancy, especially with a reported history of trauma or the presence of a mood or anxiety disorder. Such screening will allow women to receive needed treatment and referrals and mitigate the potentially negative sequelae of PTSD.

Summary For a child psychiatrist, interactions between mother and child are of major importance to understand human personality and its dysfunction. However, what about perinatal depression and its consequences for the mother, child and their interaction? The aim of this prospective case-control study summary was to assess, in a same cohort, the effect of pre- and post-natal depression on new born and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables, and on mother-child interaction at two months (PHRC AOM 02082). We evaluated maternal depression as early as during pregnancy and followed its evolution and consequences regarding psychological development in children and interactions. Method We screened 205 pregnant women for depressive symptoms from April 2004 to November 2006. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group was based on meeting DSMIV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group by routine screening at two, six and 12 months. Anxiety and stress were respectively assessed on Stait Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and on Sensations during pregnancy and Life Events Questionnaire ; newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) ; early infants responses to non-contingent maternal behaviour were explored by J. Nadel's double video. Results Prenatal depression were more frequent than postnatal depression and was highly associated with a feeling of stress and anxiety of pregnancy despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery) and had a major impact on child behavioural development, particularly for boys. Post-natal depressions were responsible for interaction synchronism impairment, resulting in difficulties for the newborn in their emotional abilities to react. Conclusion Our results suggest that there is a continuity between pre- and post-natal depression, but specific risks and consequences for each period. As in animal studies which have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring, depression during pregnancy may affect development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to understanding the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders.},

Methods Seventy-nine adolescents proceeding with a pregnancy for the first time were surveyed about abuse experiences and were administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the third trimester and at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Results The prevalence of physical abuse before the age of 16 years was 20.5\% and 9\% of adolescents met the criteria for sexual abuse. Overall, 20.5\% adolescents experienced some kind of abuse (sexual or physical) and 9\% experienced both sexual and physical abuse. An experience of sexual and/or physical abuse was related to depression and anxiety in the postpartum, but not during pregnancy. Conclusions The difficulties associated with the transition to parenting may be exacerbated for adolescent childbearers who have a history of abuse, and in turn, may increase vulnerability to experiencing depression and anxiety.

  abstract = {Introduction Postpartum depression (PPD) affects women in various sociocultural environments around the world during a sensitive period of their lives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and time course of PPD in a Greek urban environment as well as possible relations of PPD with certain clinical and sociodemographic factors. Method The study was performed on a sample of 402 women that were recruited from a university obstetric clinic in Athens, Greece, during the first 24 hours after delivery. The women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale through telephone interviews. The telephone interviews were conducted the first week as well as the first, third, and sixth month after delivery. The first day after delivery, all women completed the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the List of Threatening Experience, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Whitley Index, the Schalling-Sifneos Personality Scale, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. In addition, the Blues Questionnaire was administered the first 3 days and the seventh day after delivery. Other clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained through questionnaires and personal interviews. Results A cutoff point of 12 in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to define PPD. Eighty (19.8\%) of the women in the sample experienced PPD during the first 6 months after delivery. The development of PPD was related significantly to the following factors: stressful events during pregnancy (P = .01), maternity blues on the seventh day after delivery (P = .01), obsessive preoccupation with cleaning (P = .04), and judgment that the baby is crying excessively at the first month interview (P = .02). Conclusion The women's emotional condition before and after delivery, obsessionality, and difficulties in regulating the infant's emotions appear to contribute to the development of PPD during the first 6 months after delivery.}

  abstract = {The objectives of the present longitudinal study were to (i) understand the potential impacts of concern about the COVID-19 epidemic and containment measures (e.g. lockdown) on the psychological and emotional status of women during pregnancy and after childbirth, (ii) identify factors associated with these impacts, and (iii) to study the mothers' coping strategies and protective factors. Data were collected during pregnancy (timepoint 1, during France's first period of lockdown from April 6th to May 11th, 2020) and then one month after childbirth (timepoint 2). At timepoint 1, 90 women completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. At timepoint 2, 26 women completed the City Birth Trauma Scale, the Interpersonal Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. The relationship between social support and worry about the fetus/baby during the COVID-19 pandemic was statistically significant (Rho=- 0.21; p0.05). Worry about the fetus/baby was also significantly correlated with the anxiety score (Rho=0.60; p0.01) and the depression score (Rho= 0.37, p0.01). When the study population was compared with a control sample of new mothers having given birth outside the lockdown period, we observed differences in the prevalence of anxiety but not in the prevalence of postpartum PTSD. Lastly, the relationship between posttraumatic growth and emotion regulation was not significant (Rho=0.29, p = 0.16 for soothing; Rho=0.26, p = 0.20 for social modeling; Rho=0.28; p = 0.17 for perspective-taking; Rho=0.35; p = 0.08 for enhancing positive affect). In view of the sample size and the statistical tests, this study should be considered as exploratory. Our present results open up opportunities for further research and suggest that a possible impact of COVID-19 must be considered when evaluating potential psychological disorders in the perinatal period.},

  abstract = {Introduction : When anxiety and depression are comorbid (CAD), symptoms are more severe and the response to treatments is worse. Given the links between mood disorders and poor perinatal outcomes, CAD and its correlates deserve special clinical attention during pregnancy. The main objective of this study was to learn about the prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) in early stages of the pregnancy analyzing the relationship between CAD and cultural and sociodemographic factors. Methods : We have studied a multicultural sample of 514 Turkish and Spanish pregnant women (264 in M\'alaga, 102 in Istambul and 148 in Antalya) recruited at the moment of their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated versions of the Edinburg postnatal depression scale (EDS), the state and trait anxiety scale (STAI) and a series of questions related to health status, general mood, and sociodemographic variables. Results We found a CAD prevalence rate of 26.9\% and a significant higher prevalence rate among Turkish women (47.6\%) when compared to Spanish participants (9.5\%) (p\textexclamdown 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that the lack of someone who provided emotional support was the variable that best predicted CAD symptoms. Conclusion : The CAD prevalence rate was high and significant differences were found depending on the geographic and cultural context.},

  abstract = {Objective This study of Canadian women estimates the prevalence of opioid and cannabis use during pregnancy and cannabis use during the breastfeeding period and explores the sociodemographic and mental health characteristics associated with use. Methods A total of 13 000 women who gave birth between January and June 2018 were invited to participate in the Survey on Maternal Health by Statistics Canada; 7111 women participated for a response rate of 54.7\%. Participants were asked about their mental health, supports during pregnancy, and substance use. Multivariable logistic regression was used to describe the relationship between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics and substance use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Results The prevalence of self-reported opioid use during pregnancy was 1.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.1\%\textendash 1.8\%). A higher proportion of women reported using cannabis during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, at 3.1\% (95\% CI 2.5\%\textendash 3.6\%) and 2.6\% (95\% CI 2.1\%\textendash 3.1\%), respectively. Younger age, not being in a relationship, lower level of education, and thoughts of self-harm were significantly associated with cannabis use during pregnancy. Lower level of education and thoughts of self-harm were also significantly associated with cannabis use while breastfeeding, as were symptoms of postpartum depression and/or generalized anxiety. Lower level of education and symptoms of postpartum depression and/or generalized anxiety were also significantly associated with opioid use during pregnancy. Conclusion The results of this survey show relatively low levels of opioid and cannabis use during pregnancy and cannabis use while breastfeeding in Canada. Different sociodemographic and mental health characteristics are associated with the use of these substances, and public health interventions and policies should take into account these factors. R\'esum\'e Objectif Cette \'etude men\'ee aupr\`es de Canadiennes estime la pr\'evalence de la consommation d'opio\"ides et de cannabis pendant la grossesse ainsi que la consommation de cannabis pendant l'allaitement; elle explore aussi les caract\'eristiques sociod\'emographiques et de sant\'e mentale li\'ees \`a la consommation. M\'ethodologie Au total, 13 000 femmes ayant accouch\'e entre janvier et juin 2018 ont \'et\'e invit\'ees \`a participer \`a l'Enqu\^ete sur la sant\'e maternelle de Statistique Canada; 7 111 femmes y ont particip\'e, pour un taux de r\'eponse de 54,7 \%.

  abstract = {Background Childbirth can be a traumatic experience occasionally leading to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to assess childbirth-related PTSD risk-factors using an etiological model inspired by the transactional model of stress and coping. Methods 348 out of 505 (70\%) Dutch women completed questionnaires during pregnancy, one week postpartum, and three months postpartum. A further 284 (56\%) also completed questionnaires ten months postpartum. The model was tested using path analysis. Results Antenatal depressive symptoms ({$\beta$}=.15, p\textexclamdown.05), state anxiety ({$\beta$}=.17, p\textexclamdown.01), and perinatal psychoform ({$\beta$}=.17, p\textexclamdown.01) and somatoform ({$\beta$}=.17, p\textexclamdown.01) dissociation were identified as PTSD symptom risk factors three months postpartum. Antenatal depressive symptoms ({$\beta$}=.31, p\textexclamdown.001) and perinatal somatoform dissociation ({$\beta$}=.14, p\textexclamdown.05) predicted symptoms ten months postpartum. Limitations Almost a third of our sample was lost at three months postpartum, and 44\% at ten months. The sample size was relatively small. The present study did not control for prior PTSD. The PTSD A criterion was not considered an exclusion criteria for model testing, and the fit index of the ten months model was just below suggested cut-off values. Conclusions Screening for high risk pregnant women should focus on antenatal depression, anxiety and dissociative tendencies. Hospital staff and midwives are advised to be vigilant for perinatal dissociation after intense negative emotions. To help regulate perinatal negative emotional responses, hospital staff and midwifes are recommended to provide information about birth procedures and be attentive to women's birth-related needs.},

Design an observer-blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway. Participants 105 sedentary, nulliparous pregnant women, mean age 30.7({$\pm$}4.0) years, pre-pregnancy BMI 23.8 ({$\pm$}4.3), were assigned to either exercise (n=52) or control group (n= 53) at mean gestation week 17.7 ({$\pm$}4.2). Intervention the exercise intervention followed ACOG guidelines and included a 60 minutes general fitness class, with 40 minutes of endurance training/aerobic and 20 minutes of strength training and stretching/relaxation, performed at least twice per week for a minimum of 12 weeks. Measurements outcome measures were assessed through standardized interviews pre- and post-intervention (gestation week 36.6, {$\pm$}0.9), and included psychological variables related to quality of life, well-being, body image and pregnancy depression, as well as assessment of 13 commonly reported pregnancy complaints. Findings post-intervention, using intention to treat (ITT) analysis, women randomized to exercise rated their health significantly better compared to women in the control group (p=0.02) and reported less fatigue related to everyday activities (p=0.04). Women with complete exercise adherence ({$\geq$}24 sessions) had significantly better scores on measurements of feelings related to sadness, hopelessness and anxiety (p\textexclamdown 0.01), compared to the control group. Contradictory, the control group reported higher life enjoyment (p\textexclamdown 0.01). There were no significant group differences in body-image or pregnancy depression. With respect to analysing pregnancy complaints according to ITT, no differences between the groups were found. A comparison of the women who attended {$\geq$}19 (80\%, n=21) or {$\geq$}24 (100\%, n=14) exercise sessions with the control-participants, showed that fewer women in the exercise group reported nausea/vomiting and numbness/poor circulation in legs. Key conclusion and implication for practise participation in regular group exercise during pregnancy contributed to improvements in some variables related to maternal well-being and quality of life. Women with high exercise adherence had significantly better results on several health variables reaping the highest benefits. A qualitative study exploring the barriers of women in achieving recommended amount of activity may be necessary to understand this population and developing better clinical practice educational tools.},

  abstract = {Background Data concerning the impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection on the mental health of pregnant women are still limited. The study explored baseline information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the perinatal period, among mothers infected with COVID-19, during the first wave of the epidemic in Jordan. The current study aimed to examine the anxiety levels of pregnant women infected with coronavirus over the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from March to December 2021, using an online survey that addressed key issues related to the role of COVID-19 infection in developing anxiety among pregnant women using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The study population was pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and who agreed to participate in the study (n=530). Results The results indicated that one-third of the women had contracted coronavirus infection in each trimester. Most had no pregnancy complications (78.0\%), 42.0\% had no symptoms of coronavirus infection, 10.0\% were hospitalized and 2.0\% were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Approximately half declared that they did not receive support from the medical staff, although 71.0\% had very good support from their families. Nearly a quarter of respondents stopped smiling while infected, 19\% did not want to have any entertainment, and one-third had sleep problems. Moreover, more than half of the pregnant women were feeling anxiety (58.0\%) and fear (59.0\%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 67\%. The EPDS scores were statistically significant and associated with being a smoker, method of delivery, getting COVID-19, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and being admitted to a hospital or ICU. Conclusions This study highlights that healthcare providers and family members should pay more attention to maternal mental health during a pandemic. Fear and anxiety among pregnant women need to be taken into account more during the period of international crises, taking into account the mental health of the pregnant woman when developing health plans, developing health programs, and providing diagnostic and therapeutic management in the maternal care departments.},

Depression negatively affects engagement in HIV care, but systematic screening for perinatal depression is not done in most sub-Saharan African countries. Estimating the burden and timing of perinatal depression can help inform medical programs with the current scale-up of HIV care for pregnant women. Methods Women (n = 299) initiating antiretroviral therapy for HIV were recruited from a government antenatal clinic in Malawi in 2015\textendash 2016 into a cohort study. Probable perinatal depression was assessed at enrollment and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We estimated point prevalence and incidence of depression as well as concordance between EPDS and PHQ-9 scores. Results One in ten women screened positive for probable antenatal depression, whereas 1\textendash 6\% screened positive postpartum. Sensitivity analyses to account for loss to follow-up suggested that postpartum depression prevalence could have ranged from 1\textendash 11\%. At postpartum time points, 0\textendash 3\% of participants screened positive for incident probable depression. EPDS and PHQ-9 scores were concordant for 96\% of assessments during antenatal and postpartum visits. Limitations Lack of diagnostic psychiatric evaluation precludes actual diagnosis of major depression, and social desirability bias may have contributed to low postpartum scores. Conclusions Probable depression was more common during the antenatal period than postpartum among our participants. Given the association between depression and negative HIV outcomes, screening for depression during pregnancy should be integrated into antenatal HIV care.},

This study aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with PTS-C and PTS-O in postpartum women. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional population-based survey of 16,000 postpartum women, selected at random from birth registrations in England to receive a postal questionnaire, including the Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 4,509 women. The median age was 32 years (IQR=29-36), 64\% were married, 77\% were UK-born, and 76\% were White-British. Prevalence of PTS-C was 2.5\% (95\%CI:2.0-3.0) and prevalence of PTS-O was 6.8\% (95\%CI:6.0-7.8). Women with PTS-C were significantly more likely to report re-experiencing symptoms (Chi-Square=7.69,p\textexclamdown 0.01). Factors associated with PTS-C were: higher level of deprivation, not having a health professional to talk to about sensitive issues during pregnancy, and the baby being admitted for neonatal intensive care. Factors associated with PTS-O were: age {$\leq$}24 years, depression during pregnancy, and having a pregnancy affected by long-term health problems. Factors associated with both were: living without a partner, anxiety during pregnancy, pregnancy-specific health problems, and lower birth satisfaction. Conclusions: PTS during the postpartum period is relatively common and, for many women, unrelated to childbirth. Increased awareness among health professionals of prevalence, clinical characteristics and factors associated with postpartum PTS-C and PTS-O will aid the development of appropriate management protocols to identify and support women during the perinatal period.

Materials and methods A case\textendash control study of women with T2DM (n=160) matched by age range to controls without T2DM (n=160). Data were collected in the Negeri Sembilan and PutraJaya regions in Malaysia, from two hospital outpatient clinics, PutraJaya Hospital and Tuanku Jaa'far Hospital Seremban, and one health clinic at Seremban. Validated, interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to obtain the data. The unadjusted and adjusted estimates were calculated using the Mantel\textendash Haenszel method. Results Neither depression (RR 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.39\textendash 1.41) nor anxiety (RR 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.53\textendash 1.88) symptoms increased the risk of T2DM significantly. However, gestational diabetes (RR 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.02\textendash 1.79), and {$\geq$}3 pregnancies (RR 1.39, 95\% CI: 1.08\textendash 1.79) were significant risk factors for the development of T2DM.

Conclusion In this study, T2DM is not a significant risk factor for depression and anxiety; similarly, neither are depression and anxiety significant risk factors for T2DM. Although prevalence of depression and anxiety is not alarming, the findings reported here should alert clinicians to screen and treat anxiety and depression in people with diabetes and also note the importance of monitoring women with complications in pregnancy for risk of later T2DM.},

However, these findings are based mainly on studies using clinic or health plan populations. In this study, we examined the association between intimate partner abuse (IPA) and health concerns and health care utilization in a population-based sample of adult women. Methods: We analyzed data on 2043 women aged 18 to 59 who participated in the 1998 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based health survey that included questions on IPA. IPA was defined as experiencing physical violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Consequences of IPA and self-rated health status and health care utilization of women experiencing IPA were examined. Results: A total of 6.3\% of Massachusetts women aged 18 to 59 reported IPA during the past year. Women experiencing IPA were more likely than other women to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Women experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance, but received routine health care at similar rates as other women. Conclusions: These results indicate that women in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for several serious emotional and physical health concerns. Most of these women are in routine contact with health care providers. These findings also suggest that the BRFSS may provide a valuable mechanism for tracking state-based IPA prevalence rates over time.},

There is a paucity of research regarding prevalence, risks, and predictors of postpartum anxiety in parents after VLBW birth. Methods Parents with VLBW infants and parents with term infants were recruited into the longitudinal HaFEn-study at the three largest centers of perinatal care in Hamburg, Germany. State anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and anxiety and adjustment disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, social support, trait anxiety, stress during birth, socioeconomic status, risks during pregnancy, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of postpartum state anxiety in both parents simultaneously a multiple random coefficient model was used. Results 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for minor/major anxiety symptoms and adjustment disorders was higher in parents with VLBW infants compared to the term group. The risk for anxiety disorders was not higher in parents with VLBW infants. The most important predictors for postpartum state anxiety were high trait anxiety, the birth of a VLBW infant, high stress during birth, and low social support. Limitations Data reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, temporal relationships cannot be established. Conclusions Our results emphasize the importance of early screening for postpartum anxiety in both parents with VLBW infants.},

  abstract = {Objective This prospective study investigated associations between maternal stress exposure and maternal psychological stress measures during pregnancy with obstetric and neonatal outcomes. We also tested whether any observed associations would be moderated by increasing glucose levels, as increased glycaemia is also associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Methods 203 women between 24 and 30 weeks gestation completed validated questionnaires assessing pregnancy-related major events and major life events, maternal perceived stress, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Glucose was measured using fasting morning blood samples. Instrumental delivery represented an obstetric outcome. Neonatal outcomes included Apgar score, large and small for gestational age weight, cord blood pH, NICU hospitalization, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Results Regarding the obstetric outcome, pregnancy-related major life events OR = 1.346 (1.016\textendash 1.783; p = .016) were related to more incidences of instrumental delivery. Regarding neonatal outcomes, exposure to major life events in the last 12 months was associated with lower cord blood pH values B = -0.155 (-0.059 to -0.002; p = .036) and with more incidences of hypoglycaemia OR = 0.165 (0.012\textendash 0.169; p = .04). Maternal psychological stress measures were related to more incidences of instrumental delivery OR = 1.018 (1.003\textendash 1.032; p = .013). Maternal stress perception was associated with higher cord blood pH values B = 0.155 (0\textendash 0.003; p = .046) and fewer NICU hospitalisations OR = -0.170 (-0.009 to -0.001; p = .019). Some of these associations between life events and stress perceptions with neonatal outcomes were moderated by fasting glucose levels. Conclusion Maternal pregnancy events as well as stress, depression and anxiety symptoms have a negative impact on obstetric outcomes and maternal life events are associated with negative neonatal outcomes. Higher fasting glucose levels moderate some of the relationships between stress and neonatal outcomes.},

The risk factors for PPD include both individual factors and joint couple/dyadic factors, and both should be addressed by prevention programs. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a dyadic PPD prevention program that targets both individual and couple/dyadic factors. The 5-week, online PPD prevention program included 18 couples (n=36, i.e., pregnant mothers and their partners). Data on individual and dyadic factors were collected at baseline and post-intervention. Feasibility data indicated that the program was both acceptable and well-received. Participants felt satisfied with the knowledge learned and skills gained in the program (91.6\% of mothers, 90\% of partners). Based on the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, participants demonstrated significant coping skills knowledge increases compared to pre-intervention scores (Z=-2.251, r=0.650, p=0.031 and Z=-2.264, r=0.716, p=0.031, for mothers and partners respectively). In addition, PPD knowledge also increased significantly for both parents (Z=-2.594, r=0.749, p=0.008 and Z=-2.419, r=0.765, p=0.013). Self-esteem increased significantly for mothers and partners as well (Z=-2.816, r=0.813, p=0.002 and Z=-2.657, r=0.840, p=0.006). Non-significant improvements in communication quality, depression, anxiety, social support, and relationship satisfaction for couples (with effect sizes ranging from 0.116 to 0.600) indicate that this program may have the potential to positively influence several individual and joint risk factors for PPD.

Residential noise exposure has been associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression in the general population. However, limited study has been conducted in pregnant women. Objective To examine the associations of residential noise exposure with prenatal anxiety and depression. Methods Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Center for Epidemiological Survey Scale (CES-D) were used to assess the status of prenatal anxiety and depression for 2,018 pregnant women in Shanghai, China. Residential noise exposure was represented by a land use regression model. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the associations of noise exposure with prenatal anxiety and depression. Results The prevalence rates of prenatal anxiety and depression were 7.5 \% and 8.1 \%, respectively. The mean ({$\pm$}standard deviation) residential noise exposure during the whole pregnancy was 60.69 ({$\pm$}3.31) dB (A). Higher residential noise exposure was associated with increased odds of both prenatal anxiety and depression. Compared with low level of noise exposure group (\textexclamdown 65 dB(A)), the odds of prenatal anxiety and depression increased 69 \% (OR = 1.69, 95 \% CI, 1.01\textendash 2.82) and 71 \% (OR = 1.71, 95 \% CI, 1.05\textendash 2.80) in higher noise exposure group ({$\geq$}65 dB(A)), respectively.

Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress. Methods The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night. Results We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8\% vs. 6.2\%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5\% vs. 9.6\%). Overall, 11.8\% of the women and 14.9\% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95\% CI 2.6\textendash 5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1\textendash 3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95\% CI 1.8\textendash 5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men. Conclusions The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.},

Findings 27.9\% (n=290) of the 1,039 women were found to be experiencing depression at a level requiring treatment. In a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis model developed for depression and anxiety, the following were found to be statistically significant factors influencing the experience of both depression and anxiety: perceived social support; recent experience of marital or emotional problems during and before this pregnancy; recent experience of life stress; having a negative self-perception; experience of physical violence; and experience of physical problems during pregnancy. Statistically significant factors influencing depression were marital dissatisfaction, being a housewife, having an unwanted pregnancy, and having a formal marriage. The correlation between total anxiety and depression scores was at a medium level (Pearson correlation=0.592). Key conclusions many factors influenced the development of depression and anxiety in pregnancy, and a positive correlation was found between depression and anxiety.

They probably do not have a substantially higher incidence in pregnancy, but they are independently associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes. These include prematurity, low birth weight and an increase in the rate of major malformations. Whilst maternal death arising as a consequence of psychiatric disorder is relatively uncommon, it continues to feature prominently as one of the leading preventable contributors to maternal mortality in the developed world. Conversely, the inappropriate attribution of physical complaints to underlying psychiatric disorder, and the misdiagnosis of delirium as psychiatric disorder, have both been associated with maternal mortality from undiagnosed physical causes. Milder psychiatric disorders presenting in pregnancy can be managed by primary care services, where access to psychological treatments can often be speedier. Women with more severe disorders need specialist care, ideally from a perinatal mental health service sitting within a perinatal mental health network that incorporates a mother and baby unit. Women and their partners should be fully involved in discussions about mental health treatment choices and the balance of risks involved, including the background rate of adverse outcomes that can occur by chance. Decisions about medication should be carefully documented and summarized in a letter written in plain English that is copied to the woman for her information.},

  abstract = {Background Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely to experience several pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm births than women without polycystic ovary syndrome. However, at present, there is limited research on whether polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with both anxiety and depression during pregnancy and whether this augments a woman's risk of postpartum depression, particularly among high-risk populations who have limited access to care. Objective Our primary objective was to assess the association between prepregnancy polycystic ovary syndrome and postpartum depression, considering important baseline confounding factors. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the mediating role of prenatal depression and anxiety on the association between polycystic ovary syndrome and postpartum depression. Study Design This study involved a population-based sample of 3906 postpartum (2\textendash 6 months) women who completed the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Phase 8 questionnaire (2016\textendash 2018). Weighted adjusted prevalence ratios were used to assess the association between polycystic ovary syndrome and postpartum depression, considering potential confounding factors and assessing mediating effects of depression and anxiety experienced during pregnancy. Results Following the exclusion criteria, 8.2\% of women reported clinical polycystic ovary syndrome and 19.1\%, 6.2\%, and 4.4\% reported irregular periods and acne, irregular periods and hirsutism, and all 3 symptoms, respectively. Moreover, 17.7\% and 23.5\% reported experiencing prenatal depression and anxiety and 9.5\% and 10.2\% reported experiencing postpartum depressed mood and anhedonia, respectively. Clinical polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a 1.76 higher adjusted prevalence ratio (95\% confidence interval, 1.03\textendash 3.00) for postpartum depressed mood or anhedonia after taking into consideration age, prepregnancy body mass index, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. A similar higher prevalence was seen for irregular periods and acne (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.65; 95\% confidence interval, 1.13\textendash 2.41), irregular periods and hirsutism (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.40; 95\% confidence interval, 0.82\textendash 2.40), and all 3 symptoms (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.75; 95\% confidence interval, 0.96\textendash 3.19) and postpartum depressed mood or anhedonia. Prenatal depression and anxiety mediated 20\% and 32\% of the effect of clinical polycystic ovary syndrome on postpartum depressed mood and anhedonia, respectively. Conclusion Clinical polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with postpartum depressed mood and symptoms among this population-based sample inclusive of high-risk mothers. Prenatal depression and anxiety mediate this association, emphasizing the importance of prenatal psychological screening among women with polycystic ovary syndrome. An additional important clinical and public health implication of this study lies in the finding that nearly 20\% of women in this population-based sample who reported at least 2 polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms (including at-risk women who may not have access to care) had not received a clinical diagnosis for polycystic ovary syndrome.},

Measurements and Findings Mental disorders were assessed using the ``Depression Anxiety Stress Scale'' and social support was determined using the ``Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.'' Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2\%, 44.6\%, and 32.2\% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression. Key Conclusions The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term. Implications for practice Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.},

Methods Pregnant veterans were recruited from 15 Veterans Health Administration sites across the United States; our sample included 501 participants. Sociodemographic characteristics, military service, health status, and pregnancy related factors, as well as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), were collected as part of a telephone survey. Additional data were obtained from electronic health record data. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine factors associated with an EPDS score suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms ({$\geq$}10). Findings Prenatal EPDS scores of 10 or greater were calculated for 28\% of our sample. Our final model indicated that factors associated with decreased odds of an EPDS score of 10 or greater included spousal or partner support during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.35; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.16\textendash 0.77) and employment (aOR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.24\textendash 0.67). A past diagnosis of anxiety (aOR, 2.54; 95\% CI, 1.43\textendash 4.50), past antidepressant use (aOR, 3.27; 95\% CI, 1.71\textendash 6.24), and active duty service (aOR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.08\textendash 3.37) were associated with increased odds of having an EPDS score of 10 or greater. Conclusions This is the first quantitative estimate of depression symptoms in pregnant veterans across multiple Veterans Affairs facilities. The prevalence of depression symptomology was greater than the high end of prevalence estimates in the general pregnant population. Given that the risk of depression increases during the postpartum period, women who can be identified with depressive symptomatology during pregnancy can be offered critical resources and support before giving birth.}

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess psychological state of women who experienced postponement of ART care during the first COVID-19 wave in a French public ward of reproductive medicine. Methods: An online anonymous survey was emailed between July and August 2020 to all women whose infertility care, including the first consultation for infertility, have been delayed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Feelings about COVID-19 outbreak, lockdown and suspension of fertility care were assessed by Multiple-Choice Questions and Visual Analog Scales. Results: 435 women answered to the survey (response rate 34.6\%). Mean levels of the HADS-A (anxiety), HADS-D (depression) and PSS10 were respectively 7.58({$\pm$}3.85), 4.51({$\pm$}3.48), and 27({$\pm$}6.75). Prevalence of stress was 50.8\% and almost half of women presented clear or suggestive anxiety symptoms (respectively 21.6\% and 25.7\%). Stress and anxiety rates were much higher than those expected in infertile population. Increased stress was observed in women above 35 years and those stopped `in cycle' or during pre-treatment for in-vitro fertilization or frozen embryo transfer. Patient with history of depression or anxiety had a higher prevalence of perceived stress (p = 0.0006). Postponement was perceived as `unbearable' for women experiencing stress (p = 0.0032). After the first wave of pandemic, pregnancy desire remained the same and 84.3\% of women wanted to resume fertility care as soon as possible. Conclusion: Stopping fertility care during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact on women with an increase of stress, and anxiety. Psychological counseling should always be offered especially during this difficult period.},

  abstract = {Research question Are maternal depression and/or anxiety disorders (MDAD) before and during pregnancy associated with IVF outcomes? Design A total of 5661 women starting their first IVF cycle between 15 August 2014 and 31 December 2015 were pooled from a prospective cohort of IVF-conceived children. The self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were used to determine MDAD. IVF outcomes were compared between MDAD+ and MDAD\textendash{} groups. Results A total of 10.3\% (572/5556) of women had MDAD before IVF (bMDAD). The fertilization rate was lower in the bMDAD+ group (59.41 {$\pm$} 22.11\% versus 61.72 {$\pm$} 22.18\%, Padjust \textexclamdown{} 0.05). No difference was found in the other IVF outcomes. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with singleton live births were similar between the two groups. A total of 17.4\% (347) women with singleton live births had MDAD during the first trimester (pMDAD). Birthweight (3383 {$\pm$} 556 g versus 3447 {$\pm$} 518 g, Padjust \textexclamdown{} 0.05) was lower and incidence of low birthweight (LBW) (6.9\% versus 3.3\%, Padjust \textexclamdown{} 0.01) was higher in the pMDAD group. After adjustment for potential confounders (gestational age, maternal age, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, threatened abortion, hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus), pMDAD remained significantly associated with LBW (odds ratio [OR] 2.50, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.16\textendash 5.42, Padjust \textexclamdown{} 0.05). The preconception psychological state in the pMDAD group did not demonstrate any additional impact on neonatal outcomes. Conclusions MDAD during the first trimester is associated with increased risk of LBW in offspring, whether preconception MDAD exists or not.},

  abstract = {Background This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an antenatal psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum depression in Mexican women. Method Pregnant women at high risk for depression were randomized to intervention or a usual care condition. Assessments of depression (SCID, BDI-II) occurred during pregnancy, 6weeks and 4\textendash 6months postnatally, and subjective impact of the intervention in the postpartum. Results Of the 6484 women approached, 377 were eligible and consented to randomization (250 intervention, 127 control). Sixty-eight intervention (27.2\%) and 68 (53.5\%) control participants completed the three assessment periods. The cumulative incidence of major depression over three time periods was significantly lower (p\textexclamdown 0.05) in the intervention (10.7\%) than the control group (25\%). Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant reduction of BDI-II in both groups, but no significant treatment effect. Even when controlling for initial levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, a treatment effect on depressive symptoms could not be confirmed, although there was a trend demonstrating that intervention participants with high initial symptoms had a larger reduction of BDI-II. Most participants that completed the intervention reported that it had a medium to great influence on their well-being, depression, current problems, role as mothers and their relationship with the baby. Limitations Attrition was the most salient methodological problem in this study. Conclusions This is the first randomized control depression prevention trial in high-risk pregnant Mexican women. Available data are consistent with the possibility that the incidence of depression may have been reduced by the intervention, but differential attrition makes interpretation of the findings difficult.},

Presence of depression, anxiety or stress in pregnancy may increase the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of neonatal outcomes and its association among mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus with and without the presence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in Malaysia. Design This was a cross-sectional study. Setting Tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. Participants Mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 418) who deliver their neonates at two major tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. Measurements Neonatal outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, macrosomia, metabolic and electrolyte disorders, neonatal respiratory distress and congenital anomalies were determined. Findings Prevalence of low birth weight in neonates born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus was 14.6\%, followed by metabolic and electrolyte disorders 10.5\%, preterm birth 9.1\%, macrosomia 4.8\%, neonatal respiratory distress 5.8\% and congenital anomalies (2.4\%). Among the adverse neonatal outcomes, neonatal respiratory distress was significantly associated with the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus using univariate analysis (p = 0.010). After controlling for confounding factors, predictors for neonatal respiratory distress at delivery were the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (Adjusted OR = 3.87, 95\% CI = 1.32-11.35), living without a husband (Adjusted OR = 9.74, 95\% CI = 2.04\textendash 46.51), preterm delivery (Adjusted OR = 7.20, 95\% CI = 2.23\textendash 23.30), caesarean section (Adjusted OR = 3.33, 95\% CI = 1.09\textendash 10.15), being nulliparous and primiparous (Adjusted OR = 3.62, 95\% CI = 1.17\textendash 11.17) and having family history of diabetes (Adjusted OR = 3.20, 95\% CI = 1.11\textendash 9.21). Key conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate the positive association of neonatal respiratory distress with the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus. Implications for practice It is therefore important to identify depression symptoms after a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant mothers is made to enable early referral and interventions.},

This study presents nationally representative data on the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of depression in women during pregnancy and postpartum in the United States. Method Data were drawn from the 2001\textendash 2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a survey of 43,093 adults aged 18years and older residing in households in the United States of whom 14,549 were women 18 to 50years old with known past-year pregnancy status. Diagnoses of depression and other mood, anxiety, and drug disorders were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule \textemdash{} DSM-IV version. Results The overall prevalence of MDE during pregnancy was 12.4\%. Among pregnant and postpartum women, depression was associated with younger age, ethnicity other than Latino, being widowed, divorced, separated or never married, traumatic events within the past 12months and pregnancy complication. Strong associations were found between MDE during pregnancy and postpartum and nearly all 12-month psychiatric disorders. Past-year depressed pregnant and postpartum women were more likely than nondepressed pregnant women to use substances (including alcohol, illicit drugs and cigarettes). Past-year pregnant and postpartum women were significantly less likely to receive past-year treatment for depression than nonpregnant women although not after adjusting for background sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions These results indicate that depression during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with a large range of psychiatric disorders. The high frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, the elevated use of any substances and the high rate of unmet needs should be kept in mind when considering the management of depression during pregnancy and postpartum.},

  abstract = {Background Recently, studies have begun emphasizing paternal involvement during the perinatal period and its impact on maternal health. However, most studies have assessed maternal perception and focused on adolescents or minority groups in Western countries. Therefore, the current study investigated the association between paternal involvement and maternal postnatal depression and anxiety, along with the effects of maternal job status in the Asian society of Taiwan. Methods This study recruited pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy as well as their partners on prenatal visits from July 2011 to September 2013 at four selected hospitals in metropolitan areas of Taipei, Taiwan. In total, 593 parental pairs completed the first interview and responded to the follow-up questionnaires until 6 months postpartum. Self-reported data were collected, and multiple logistic regression models were used for analyses. Results Lower paternal childcare and nursing frequency was independently associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =4.33, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.34\textendash 13.98), particularly among unemployed mothers. Furthermore, among unemployed mothers, the risk of postnatal anxiety was 3.14 times higher in couples with fathers spending less time with the child, compared with couples with fathers spending more time (95\% CI=1.10\textendash 8.98). However, no significant findings were obtained for employed mothers. Conclusions The high prevalence of maternal postnatal emotional disturbances warrants continual consideration. Higher paternal involvement in childcare arrangements should be emphasized to aid in ameliorating these maternal emotional disturbances, particularly among unemployed mothers.},

The purpose of this paper was to evaluate relationships between sociodemographic, perinatal variables, and PPA and PPD symptoms of parturients 6 weeks postpartum. Methods A cross-sectional survey with 1204 women who had a healthy and term birth in a baby-friendly hospital, Shanghai, China. PPA and PPD symptoms were measured by using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results The mean score of SAS and EPDS was 40.79 {$\pm$} 8.48 and 8.18 {$\pm$} 5.80, respectively. The estimated prevalence of PPA and PPD symptoms was 15.2\% and 23.2\%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of fatigue and PPD symptoms were risk factors for PPA symptoms, whereas having support from family and being satisfied with labor experience were protective factors. In terms of PPD symptoms, its risk factors included smoking before pregnancy, maternal separation from baby, fatigue, encountering difficulties in breastfeeding, and the presence of PPA symptoms. In contrast, the protective factors for PPD symptoms were having support from family and having support from colleagues or friends. Limitations Convenience sampling and voluntary participation may have led to a selection bias. Conclusion PPA and PPD symptoms occur commonly among parturients in Shanghai, China. The findings from this research provide a better understanding of factors associated with PPA and PPD symptoms and will help guide personalized approaches to the management of postpartum anxiety and depression.},

Yet rigorous comparison of the prevalence of maternal mental health problems across countries is lacking. Moreover, whether stress is a common predictor of maternal mental health during the pandemic across countries is unknown. Methods 8148 pregnant women from Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States were enrolled in the International COVID-19 Pregnancy Experiences (I-COPE) Study between April 17 and May 31, 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, pandemic-related stress, pregnancy-specific stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed with well-validated instruments. The magnitude of stress and mood disturbances was compared across countries. A path model predicting clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression from maternal characteristics and stress was tested for all study participants and then examined separately in each country with \textquestiondown 200 participants. Results Countries differed significantly in magnitude of pandemic-related pregnancy stress and pandemic-unrelated pregnancy-specific stress, and in prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression levels. A well-fitting common path model for the entire sample indicated that mood and anxiety disturbances were strongly predicted by pandemic-related and pregnancy-specific stress after accounting for maternal characteristics. The model was replicated in individual countries. Conclusions Although pregnant women in high-income Western countries experienced different levels of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, stress is a strong, common predictor of anxiety and depressive symptoms in these individuals. The common model can be used to inform research and clinical interventions to protect against adverse consequences of prenatal maternal stress, anxiety, and depression for mothers and infants.},

Subsequently, multiple logistic regression model was used to examine the association of lifestyle patterns with meal skipping and delaying. In total, 32 (35.6\%) women had irregular meals, in which 25 (27.8\%) and 26 (28.9\%) women reported meal skipping and meal delaying for at least 3 times a week, respectively. Women with `poor sleep and emotion' pattern as characterized by higher scores for poor sleep, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were associated with higher odds of meal skipping (OR 1.99; 95\% CI 1.13, 3.53) and meal delaying (2.50; 1.31, 4.79). `Sedentary' pattern, as characterized by greater daily time spent on television and screen electronic devices, and `weight and inactivity' pattern, as characterized by higher BMI and physical inactivity level, were not associated with meal regularity. In this study, almost one-third of women reporting meal irregularities during pregnancy. `Poor sleep and emotion' pattern is associated with a higher incidence of meal skipping and delaying.

Conclusions Women giving birth a second time were more prone to have anxiety symptoms among the prenatal women and the whole sample, and less likely to have depressive symptoms among the postpartum women. Efficacious measures and interventions are essential to improve maternal mental health.},

  abstract = {Background Prenatal anxiety/depression has been a major public health problem globally with higher prevalence in developing countries, which leads to negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Maternal stress varies over the course of pregnancy and the stress occurring in early pregnancy is the most critical. However, few studies have focused on the impact of resilience to stress on mental health of pregnant women. Aims To explore the effect of resilience to stress on prenatal anxiety/depression in pregnant women. Methods 2813 participants were recruited from Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) in this study. The Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) was used to assess stress at 12\textendash 16 weeks of pregnancy and at 32\textendash 36 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Resilience was assessed by the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) at 12\textendash 16 weeks of pregnancy. The prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed at 32\textendash 26 weeks of pregnancy by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the direct effect of stress and resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression. The indirect effects of mediation were analyzed by structural equation models, and the indirect effect of modification was examined by stratification analysis. Results There were 11.1\% and 10.3\% of pregnant women in Shanghai MCPC indicating anxiety and depressive mood, respectively. The stress caused by both subjective and objective events at 32\textendash 36 weeks of pregnancy is less than that at 12\textendash 16weeks of pregnancy. We found that resilience was a protective factor for maternal mental health and meanwhile it was both an effect modifier and a mediator to the association between stress and prenatal anxiety/depression, with the mediating effect ratio of 15.1\% and 23.8\%, respectively. Limitations The existence of recall bias, missing data, and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the generalizability of the study. The measurements of resilience, prenatal anxiety, and depression were not designed specifically for pregnant women, so that they might have missed some important indications of mental issues related to pregnant women only. Conclusions Resilience could be a direct and indirect protective factor for prenatal anxiety and depression caused by pregnancy stress.},

  abstract = {We examined if perfectionism and the perception of being an anxious person were associated with more negative infant temperament ratings by the mothers. 386 women (mean age=30.08; standard deviation=4.21) in their last trimester of pregnancy completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and an item about their perception of being or not an anxious person. The Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies and the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness were used to generate diagnoses according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. After delivery, women completed eight items of the Difficult Infant Temperament Questionnaire (developed by our team) and filled in, again, the BDI-II and were interviewed with the DIGS. Women with depression (DSM-IV/ICD-10) and probable cases of depression using different cut-offs adjusted to Portuguese prevalence (BDI-II), in pregnancy and postpartum, were excluded. The Difficult Infant Temperament Questionnaire showed to have factorial validity and internal consistency. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between perfectionism total scale score and item 6 from the temperament scale (``is your baby irritable or fussy?''). Considering MPS 3-factor solution found for pregnancy there was also a statistically significant negative correlation between SOP and the same item. Women with low SOP differed from those with medium and high SOP in the total temperament score. Moreover, the low SOP group differed from the medium group on items three and four scores. There were no significant associations with SPP, which is the dimension more closely associated with negative outcomes. There was an association between anxiety trait status (having it or not) and scoring low, medium or high in the infant temperament scale. The proportion of anxious vs. non-anxious women presenting a high score on the infant temperament scale was higher (24.2\% vs. 12.9\%). Linear regressions showed that SOP (low vs. medium/high) offered a significant contribution to the prediction of total temperament scale score and items 3 and 4 scores, but a logistic regression did not confirm trait anxiety as a significant predictor of mother's infant temperament perception. Concluding, a major result concerns the fact that higher levels of adaptive perfectionism (i.e. SOP) are associated (and predict) a less negative view of their infant's temperament. These results on the effect of mother's anxiety and perfectionism on the child temperament perception might have treatment implications. As perfectionism is not always maladaptive, some of its positive features could be used to enhance women's self-efficacy/sense of parental competence in their role as mothers and positive affect towards their infants. Also, antenatal interventions aimed at minimising anxiety could help to optimise infant temperament outcomes, which could, eventually, also, lead to subsequent maternal and infant mental health better outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the prevalence of mental health problems during the perinatal period, little research has examined psychotic symptoms in a community sample across pregnancy and the postpartum. Exposure to environmental risk factors, and immigration in particular, are associated with increased risk for psychotic disorders. The current investigation examined whether psychosocial risk and immigrant status would predict levels of delusional ideation across the perinatal period when controlling for depression, anxiety, and demographic factors. Methods A community sample of 316 pregnant women was assessed at 12\textendash 14 and 32\textendash 34weeks gestation during routine clinic visits, and at 7\textendash 9weeks postpartum during a home visit. Measures included self-report ratings of psychosocial risk (e.g., history of mental health problems or abuse, stressful life events, lack of social support), pregnancy-related anxiety, depressive symptomatology, and delusional ideation. Results There was less delusional ideation during the postpartum period than during early pregnancy. Across all time points, levels of delusional ideation were lower than in the general population. Analyses using multilevel modeling indicated significant fixed-effects for the variables time, age, partnership, being religious and prenatal anxiety, but not depressive symptomatology, on delusional ideation. Immigrant status moderated the effect of psychosocial risk such that greater psychosocial risk predicted more symptoms of delusional ideation among immigrants, but not non-immigrants. Conclusion Psychosocial risk factors place immigrant women at an increased likelihood for experiencing delusional ideation during the perinatal period.},

  abstract = {Objective Perampanel is a once-daily oral anti-seizure medication for focal-onset seizures, with or without focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Study 402 (NCT02033902) collected safety information on clinically important treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from real-world clinical practice in patients aged {$\geq$}12 years with refractory epilepsy who were receiving perampanel as an add-on therapy. Methods Study 402 was a multicenter, observational, 52-week cohort study conducted in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Israel, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Safety data were gathered prospectively from patients at clinic visits. The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinically important TEAEs defined as dizziness; blurred vision; somnolence; aggression; balance disorders (including ataxia and falls); weight gain; suicidality; drug abuse, misuse, dependence, and withdrawal; skin photosensitivity; and unintended pregnancy while taking levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives. Off-label use of perampanel and outcomes associated with any suspected drug\textendash drug interaction were also monitored and recorded. Secondary endpoints included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Clinical Global Impression of Change. Results Of 483 patients in the Safety Analysis Set, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 38.3 (15.1) years, 48.4\% were female, mean (SD) time since diagnosis was 23 (14.8) years, 56.5\% had focal impaired awareness seizures, and 48.7\% had FBTCS. Overall, 243 (49.3\%) patients treated with perampanel completed the study and 227 (46.0\%) patients discontinued. The most common primary reason for discontinuation was adverse events (n = 130 [26.4\%]). A total of 301 (62.3\%) patients reported at least one TEAE, of which 45 (15.0\%) patients had severe TEAEs and 256 (85.0\%) patients had TEAEs judged as mild to moderate in severity. Overall, 51 (10.6\%) patients had serious TEAEs, including two deaths that were judged as not related to perampanel, and 136 (28.2\%) patients experienced a TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation. Clinically important TEAEs were reported by 153 (31.7\%) patients, with the most common being dizziness (13.9\%), balance disorders (5.6\%), aggression (5.4\%), and weight gain (5.4\%). In general, the frequencies of clinically important TEAEs were lower in this study compared with previous interventional clinical studies, except for the incidence of suicidality (2.1\% vs 1.0\%) and aggression (5.4\% vs 5.1\%). Mean total HADS scores were similar at the end of the study compared with baseline; at the end of treatment, most (\textquestiondown 60\%) patients had no shift in HADS score category; {$\sim$}15\% of patients moved to a worse category vs baseline and {$\sim$}20\% of patients moved to an improved category vs baseline for both anxiety and depression. Based on investigator assessment, disease severity was improved in 185/415 (44.6\%) patients. A subanalysis in elderly patients aged {$\geq$}65 years showed similar results to the overall population. Conclusions The data from this observational study are consistent with the known safety profile of perampanel derived from previous interventional phase II and III clinical studies. No unusual or unexpected TEAEs were observed in this real-world clinical practice setting.},

  abstract = {Studies involving alcohol and its interactions with other neurotoxicants represent the focus of several works of research due to the fact that the use of alcohol can sometimes leads to serious health problems. Fetal exposure to alcohol and mercury has a high incidence in some regions of Brazil, where there are pregnant women who are alcoholics and live in mining areas. This work was conducted to examine the effects of combined exposure to ethanol (EtOH) and methylmercury (MeHg) in rats during the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Experimental behavioral animal models/tests were used in order to examine locomotion, anxiety, depression and memory. Pregnant rats received tap water or EtOH 22.5\% w/v (6.5g/kg per day), by gavage) during pregnancy and breast-feeding. On the 15th day of pregnancy, some groups received 8mg/kg of MeHg (by gavage). The groups were as follows: control, EtOH, MeHg and EtOH+MeHg. The experimental results showed that the EtOH, MeHg and EtOH+MeHg groups reduced the percentage of frequency and time spent in the open arms entries of the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, when compared to the control group. This result suggests an anxiogenic behavioral response. The MeHg group increased locomotor activity in the arena and the immobility time in the forced swimming test, suggestive of depression-like behavior. The EtOH+MeHg group showed greater reductions in the percentages of frequency and time spent in the open arms entries in the EPM test, suggesting a sedative-behavior since the frequency of enclosed arm entries was affected. In the inhibitory avoidance task, the EtOH+MeHg group reduced the latency of the step-down response onto the grid floor, suggesting a cognitive and behavior dysfunctions. Taken together, the results suggest that EtOH and/or MeHg intoxication during the developing CNS may be a risk for deficits related to locomotor impairment, anxiety, depression and neurocognitive functions. There is a possibility that EtOH may prevent some of the MeHg responses, but the precise mechanism of action involved in this process needs to be considered for future research.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to result from a combination of genetics and environmental factors. Several lines of evidence indicate that significant prevalence of anxiety and depression-related disorders in MS patients can influence the progression of the disease. Although we and others have already reported the consequences of prenatal maternal immune activation on anxiety and depression, less is known about the interplay between maternal inflammation, MS and gender. We here investigated the effects of maternal immune activation with Poly I:C during mid-gestation on the progression of clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of MS), and then anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in non-EAE and EAE-induced offspring were evaluated. Stress-induced corticosterone and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) levels in EAE-induced offspring were also measured. Maternal immune activation increased anxiety and depression in male offspring, but not in females. This immune challenge also resulted in an earlier onset of the EAE clinical signs in male offspring and enhanced the severity of the disease in both male and female offspring. Interestingly, the severity of the disease was associated with increased anxiety/depressive-like behaviors and elevated corticosterone or TNF-{$\alpha$} levels in both sexes. Overall, these data suggest that maternal immune activation with Poly I:C during mid-pregnancy increases anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and the clinical symptoms of EAE in a sex-dependent manner in non-EAE or EAE-induced offspring. Finally, the progression of EAE in offspring seems to be linked to maternal immune activation-induced dysregulation in neuro-immune\textendash endocrine system.},

We investigated the cumulative incidence of offspring diagnoses of depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for the 4 groups from birth to 14 years, adjusting for confounders. Results The cumulative incidence of depression among offspring exposed prenatally to SSRIs was 8.2\% (95\% CI = 3.1\textendash 13.3\%) by age 14.9 years, compared with 1.9\% (95\% CI = 0.9\textendash 2.9\%) in the psychiatric disorder, no medication group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.78; 95\% CI = 1.12\textendash 2.82; p = .02) and to 2.8\% (95\% CI = 1.4\textendash 4.3\%) in the SSRI discontinued group (HR = 1.84; 95\% CI = 1.14\textendash 2.97; p = .01). Rates of anxiety, ASD, and ADHD diagnoses were comparable to rates in offspring of mothers with a psychiatric disorder but no medication during pregnancy. Comparing SSRI exposed to unexposed individuals, the HRs were significantly elevated for each outcome. Conclusion Prenatal SSRI exposure was associated with increased rates of depression diagnoses in early adolescence but not with ASD or ADHD. Until confirmed, these findings must be balanced against the substantial adverse consequences of untreated maternal depression.},

Methods Two-hundred and seventy-seven pregnant women were assessed monthly throughout the whole pregnancy period using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) for the screening of PD and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the evaluation of severity of anxious and depressive symptoms. Results Twenty-one women (7.5\%) were diagnosed as affected by PD, of whom 12 (57.1\%) showed MD or md comorbidity. The development of PD without depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous episodes of Anxiety Disorders while the development of PD plus depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous depressive episodes and by the lack of familiar support. Limitations Given the small sample size of our anxious and depressed women, the present data need to be verified by using larger samples. Conclusions The frequent association between PD and MD or md, the analysis of risk factors and of temporal relationship strongly suggests that the panic-depressive comorbidity might represent in fact depressive disorders with intense anxiety symptoms. These findings raise the question if the PD-depressive association is a true comorbidity or reveals the anxious symptomatology of a depressive disorder (MD or md).},

Methods Participants were 3326 pregnant and 3939 postpartum women (up to six months postpartum) living in Brazil, Chile, Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. An online survey was completed between June 7th and October 31st 2020, and included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7). The pre-pandemic studies were identified through literature review. Results Prevalence of clinically significant depression (EPDS{$\geq$}13), anxiety (GAD-7 {$\geq$} 10), and co-morbid (EPDS{$\geq$}13 and GAD-7 {$\geq$} 10) symptoms was 26.7 \%, 20 \% and 15.2 \%, in pregnant women, and 32.7 \%, 26.6 \% and 20.3 \%, in postpartum women, respectively.

  abstract = {Background The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS/EPDS) is routinely used in many clinical services to screen for probable distress in antenatal and postnatal women. Typically a single administration of this scale results in a referral to a specialist mental health service if the woman scores above the service's cut-off score on the measure \textemdash{} that is, scores `high'. A few postnatal studies have shown, however, that many women when re-tested just a few weeks later no longer score `high'. This study explored this phenomenon in a sample of pregnant women, using both the EDS and an anxiety self-report measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale \textemdash{} Anxiety subscale: HADS-A). Method 164 English-speaking pregnant women attending a local public hospital's antenatal clinic for their first appointment participated. At this appointment they completed the EDS and the HADS-A, and predicted how they might be feeling in about two-week time. Approximately two weeks later they were interviewed by phone and again completed the EDS and the HADS-A, and answered questions about possible mood changes. Results Regardless of which of several cut-off scores on the EDS or HADS-A was used to define `high' scorers, approximately 50\% ({$\pm$}6\%) of women scoring high at their first appointment on either measure no longer scored `high' two weeks later. Common reasons given for their mood improvement included reduced morning sickness, reassuring results from routine tests (e.g., ultrasounds), fear of miscarriage subsiding, and a sense of reassurance following their hospital visit. Many of the women were accurate in predicting at their first appointment that they would be feeling better within a few weeks. Limitations The administration procedure for completion of the measures on the two occasions was different. Women initially completed the measures by hand, and on the second occasion over the phone. Conclusion Half the women screened as having emotional distress \textemdash{} that is, scoring `high' on self-report mood measures (i.e., EDS and HADS-A) \textemdash{} during their first hospital visit in pregnancy are likely to have transient distress for predictable reasons. Referring women to specialist mental health services based upon just one administration of these measures will therefore result in a large number of unnecessary referrals, thus possibly overstretching the resources available. We therefore believe that when women score high on a self-report mood measure, enquiring as to why this is the case, and about whether the woman expects to feel differently in a few weeks time, together with a second administration of the measures in a few weeks is a better practice, unless there are good clinical reasons to do otherwise. In addition, studies reporting prevalence rates of perinatal distress should not simply use a one-off administration of a self-report mood scale to state the probable rate of disorders or distress.},

  abstract = {Objective Literature underlines that the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is the most common measure to assess postpartum depression (PPD) worldwide and suggests that the rate of false positives is high. Furthermore, the EPDS does not distinguish between depression and anxiety. This study describes different definitions of PPD and whether pregnancy anxiety disorders are risk factors for different PPDs at both 1month and 1year postpartum. Method 1066 women were recruited during pregnancy and followed until the 12th month postpartum (N=500). Women were administered the SCID and completed the PDPI-R during pregnancy. During the postpartum women who had an EPDS score of 13 or more were administered the SCID to distinguish minor or major depressive episodes (mMD) from false positives. Results 41.5\% and 44.9\% of the PPD assessed with the EPDS were false positives at the 1st month and during the 1st year postpartum respectively. The difference observed in prevalence rates estimated with EPDS and SCID was statistically significant both at the 1st month and during the 1st year postpartum. Overall the effect of anxiety diagnoses in predicting PPD was stronger at the 1st month than during the 1st year postpartum. The role of panic disorder is associated both with probable depression (ES=0.82) and with mMD (ES=0.87) at the 1st month postpartum, and predicted mMD during the 1st year postpartum (ES=0.71). OCD predicted false positives at the 1st month postpartum (ES=0.89). Conclusion An antenatal screening of specific anxiety diagnoses could be extremely useful for the prevention of possible postpartum distress outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objective Maternal cigarette smoking is a recognised risk factor for maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and remains a significant problem in the Irish maternity system. Approximately 11\% of Irish women will continue to smoke in pregnancy, despite awareness of the negative impact on their pregnancy. Although recommendations exist for the management of pregnant smokers, information on the antenatal care of Irish smokers in pregnancy has not been described. We reviewed the care given to smokers in a large urban maternity hospital. Study design This is a retrospective cohort study of 100 consecutive smokers and 110 contemporaneous non-smokers who delivered at a large urban maternity hospital of over 8200 births per year in Oct\textendash Nov 2017. Data were obtained from both electronic patient records and chart review to ensure comprehensive capture of outcomes. Results In general, mothers who smoked were younger (29yrs vs 33yrs p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and of higher parity (1.4 vs. 1.0 p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) than non-smokers. They were less likely to have a planned pregnancy (44.4\% vs 79.6\%, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and less likely to have taken pre-conceptual folic acid (22.2\% vs 58.3\%, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). These mothers also had a higher rate of history of illicit drug use, particularly cannabis (19.1\% vs 0.9\%, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and opiates (16.1\% vs 0.9\%, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Mental health issues were commoner in smokers with 36.3\% describing depression, postnatal depression or bipolar disorder and 34.3\% experiencing anxiety disorder or panic attacks. Smoking cessation advice was identified in only 36.5\% of smokers and no smokers were referred for smoking cessation interventions. Two thirds of smokers were referred for an additional ultrasound, largely due to suspected fetal growth restriction. Infants of smoking mothers had lower mean birthweights (3.16 kg vs 3.47 kg p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and mean birth centile (27th vs 47th p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) than non-smokers. Twenty eight percent of these infants were small for gestational age, an incidence significantly higher than non-smokers at 13\% (p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Conclusion Maternal cigarette smoking appears to be a largely tolerated risk factor in the population studied, despite being associated with poor obstetric outcomes. We identified an absence of smoking cessation services and a lack of intervention and structure around care pathways.},

This has led to the concept of `developmental programming through stress'. Importantly, these effects (specifically, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and neurodevelopmental and behavioural abnormalities) can be reproduced by exposure to high glucocorticoid levels, indicating a crucial role of glucocorticoids in their causation. However, there can be important differences in outcome, depending on the exact time of exposure, as well as duration and receptor selectivity of the glucocorticoid applied. The mechanisms underlying programming by stress are still unclear but it appears that these environmental perturbations exploit epigenetic modifications of DNA and/or histones to induce stable modifications of gene expression. Programming of neuro- and behavioural development by glucocorticoids and stress are important determinants of lifetime health and should be a consideration when choosing treatments in obstetric and neonatal medicine.},

All participants were contacted again at six\textendash eight weeks and six months post partum to complete a telephone or face-to-face interview. The postnatal questionnaire included the EPDS, MSSS, and DASS-21. Setting a teaching hospital and five health centres in Irbid city in northern Jordan. Participants Arabic speaking women (n=353) between the ages of 18 and 45 years, in their last trimester of pregnancy, at low risk for obstetric complications and receiving antenatal care between November 2005 and August 2006. Findings high rates of antenatal (19\%) and postnatal depression (22\%) were reported. A regression analysis revealed that stress, anxiety, financial problems, perceived lack of parenting knowledge, difficult relationship with the mother-in-law, unplanned pregnancy, and low self-efficacy were associated with antenatal depression. These seven factors accounted for 83\% (r2=0.834) of variance in the development of probable antenatal depression. At six\textendash eight weeks post partum, a regression analysis revealed that antenatal depression, unplanned pregnancy, difficult relationship with mother-in-law, dissatisfaction with overall care, stress, lack of social support, giving birth to a female baby, feeling pressured to birth the baby quickly, and perceived low parenting knowledge were associated with postnatal depression. These nine variables accounted for 82\% (r2=0.819) of variance in the development of probable PND. Three intrapartum and postpartum variables associated with PND at six\textendash eight weeks (postpartum haemorrhage, unhelpful doctors during labour and birth, and anxiety) were no longer associated with PND at six months. Conclusions and implications for practice Jordanian women need support to prepare for labour and birth. Postpartum emotional support and assessment of symptoms of depression needs to be incorporated into routine practice. The opportunity for open discussion along with increased awareness and clarification of common misconceptions about antenatal and postnatal depression are necessary. Quality assurance systems would help reduce the rate of invasive obstetric procedures, and give greater emphasis to emotional care provided to women during the perinatal period.},

Research on fear of childbirth risk factors has produced heterogeneous results while being mostly done with expectant mothers from northern Europe, northern America, and Australia. Aims The present research investigates whether fear of childbirth can be predicted by socio-demographic variables, distressing experiences before pregnancy, medical-obstetric factors and psychological variables with a sample of 426 Italian primiparous pregnant women. Methods Subjects, recruited between the 34th and 36th week of pregnancy, completed a questionnaire packet that included the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, as well as demographic and anamnestic information. Fear of childbirth was treated as both a continuous and a dichotomous variable, in order to differentiate expectant mothers as with a severe fear of childbirth. Findings Results demonstrate that anxiety as well as couple adjustment predicted fear of childbirth when treated as a continuous variable, while clinical depression predicted severe fear of childbirth. Conclusions Findings support the key role of psychological variables in predicting fear of childbirth. Results suggest the importance of differentiating low levels of fear from intense levels of fear in order to promote adequate support interventions.},

We assessed the perinatal and postnatal risk factors associated with the occurrence of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by 11 years of age. Methods Prospective longitudinal study. Mothers completed a standardized questionnaire shortly after childbirth. We used the Development and Well-Being Assessment, administered to the mothers or legal guardians, to identify DMDD among the 11-year-old subjects. We also employed logistic regression to perform bivariate and multivariate analyses, using a theoretical model of conceptual analysis. Results We evaluated data related to 3563 subjects at 11 years of age. The prevalence of DMDD was 2.5\% (95\% CI=2.0\textendash 3.0). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the early risk factors for the development of DMDD by 11 years of age were maternal mood symptoms during pregnancy, maternal depression during the first years after childbirth, and low maternal level of education. Limitations We were unable to evaluate the genetic characteristics of the family at the birth of each subject, and there were no data available regarding the prenatal or postnatal mental health of the fathers. Conclusions The prevalence of DMDD in early adolescence is low and its risk factors are related to potentially modifiable maternal characteristics. Scientific evidence indicates that DMDD is a major predictor of other psychiatric disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Effective prenatal and postnatal mental health care could prevent mental disorders in offspring.},

Specific phobias are the most common anxiety disorder to occur during pregnancy, but studies on prevalence and clinical correlates of specific phobias, including pregnancy related specific phobias are lacking. Design Cross-sectional survey using a two-phase sampling design stratified according to being positive or negative on the Whooley questions routinely asked by midwives. Approaching all whooley positive women and drawing a random sample of Whooley negative women. Sampling weights were used to account for the bias induced by the stratified sampling. Participants 545 pregnant women attending their first antenatal appointment. Language interpreters were used where required. Setting Inner-city maternity service, London, UK. Measurements The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Mental Disorders were administered to assess mental disorders and 544 women responded to the anxiety module on specific phobias. Results The maternity population prevalence estimate for specific phobias was 8.4\% (95\%CI: 5.8\textendash 12.1\%) and for pregnancy related phobias was 1.5\% (95\%CI: 0.6\textendash 3.7\%), most of which were needle phobias.

Routinely administered screening tools (Whooley and GAD-2) were not helpful in identifying phobias. Key conclusions and implications for practice Phobias in pregnancy are common but pregnancy related phobias are rare, particularly tokophobia. As routinely administered screening tools were not helpful in identifying phobias, other indicators could be considered, such as avoidance of blood tests and requests for caesarean sections.},

Method Women were assessed during pregnancy and at six months postpartum (n = 210). The instruments used were: Stressful Life Events Scale; the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; the Anxiety Subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 and the Social Support Subscale of the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised. Results The prevalence of IPV was 10.7\% in pregnancy and 11\% during postpartum. IPV increases the risk of suffering depression in pregnancy (OR = 3.5) and at six months postpartum (OR = 18.3), as well as anxiety (OR = 5.9 and OR = 6.2, respectively). Women with lower educational attainment (OR = 3.8) and income (OR = 3.0) had a higher risk of being victims of IPV during pregnancy. Likewise, lack of SS has a great impact on IPV both during pregnancy (OR = 14.12) and the postpartum period (OR = 5.49). This association decreases the impact and significance of the relationship between perinatal depression and anxiety and IPV. Conclusions High levels of SS may partially offset the effect of IPV on postpartum depressive s and perinatal anxiety symptoms. it is necessary for IPV victims to have multiple protective factors. Lack of access to education, poverty and women's submissive role in relation to men lead to greater vulnerability, constituting a distinct social disadvantage for women.},

Additionally, individuals who report having received a lower quality of maternal care show an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety, and they are generally worse caregivers of their offspring. Therefore, an interaction between the birth weight status and the quality of maternal care perceived by the mother could affect behavioral outcomes of the children. Aims Evaluate the influence of being born SGA and parental bonding, as perceived by the mother during her infancy, on the children's behavior at 18months of age. Study design Nested cross-sectional study within a Canadian prenatal cohort (MAVAN, Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment) recruited from 2003 to 2010. Subjects Data from 305 children who were evaluated at 18months of age. Outcome measures Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire \textemdash{} ECBQ and Infant\textendash Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment \textemdash{} ITSEA) were included. Results Children born SGA whose mothers reported low maternal care during her infancy (using the Parental Bonding Instrument \textemdash{} PBI) showed lower scores in the attentional set shifting trait (ECBQ, p=0.002) and attention construct (ITSEA, p=0.05) at 18months of age. We also found that SGA increases decreases cuddliness (p=0.011) and poor perceived maternal care decreases low intensity pleasure (p=0.016) on the ECBQ. Conclusions These findings suggest a complex transgenerational transmission whereby mother's own care interacts with the fetal growth of her offspring to predict its attentional skills at 18months of age.},

However, it is unclear whether prenatal psychological distress predicts postpartum psychological distress. We studied the prevalence, comorbidity and associations of maternal depression, stress, and anxiety in the prenatal period in relation to the occurrence of these same measures in the postpartum period. Methods Data originated from the MotherToBaby study of pregnant women residing in the U.S or Canada (2016\textendash 2018). Risk ratios and 95\% Confidence Intervals using modified-Poisson regression models were used to investigate associations between prenatal psychological distress and postpartum psychological distress. Results Of the 288 women in the analysis, 21.2\% and 26.7\% of women had evidence of prenatal and postnatal psychological distress, respectively. Among those with prenatal psychological distress, 43 (70.5\%) also had postpartum psychological distress. Twenty-five (41\%) of those with prenatal and 46 (60\%) of those with postpartum psychological distress had comorbidity of at least two of the measures. Prenatal measures independently predicted the same postnatal measures; prenatal anxiety also independently predicted postpartum stress. Participants who experienced more types of prenatal psychological distress were at higher risk for postpartum depression, stress, and anxiety. Conclusion Depression, stress, and anxiety are common in pregnant women and often occur together. Prenatal psychological distress measures are associated with postnatal psychological distress measures, with stronger associations among women with more than one type of psychological distress in pregnancy. Interventions during pregnancy may reduce the risk of postpartum psychological distress.},

Despite increasing recognition of PPA, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and potential PPA triggers. Here we aimed to estimate the prevalence of perinatal anxiety disorders, and to explore the association between insomnia during late pregnancy and anxiety before and after childbirth. Methods This study was part of the large population-based Akershus Birth Cohort. We analyzed data from the hospital's birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy weeks 17 and 32 and postpartum week 8 (n = 1563). Perinatal anxiety symptoms were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Anxiety disorder measurements were based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Insomnia was measured using the Bergen Insomnia Scale. Results Among perinatal women, 10\% reported symptoms of at least one anxiety disorder. The observed prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder was higher after delivery (4.2\%) than during pregnancy (2.5\%). Multiple regression analysis, with adjustment for several psychosocial and reproductive variables, indicated that insomnia during pregnancy was significantly associated with postpartum anxiety symptoms. However, this association was markedly weakened when depression variables were included in the analysis, indicating that gestational insomnia may also be a marker for a mood disorder. Limitations Immigrant and single women were underrepresented in our sample. Conclusions Our results suggest that anxiety disorders are prevalent during the perinatal period. Moreover, insomnia during pregnancy is associated with perinatal anxiety.

Conclusion Our results suggest that mid-pregnancy insomnia is a marker for concurrent anxiety and predictor of postpartum anxiety. Future research should examine whether insomnia treatment starting in mid-pregnancy reduces both perinatal insomnia and anxiety. Health providers should also be aware that postpartum women have an increased risk of developing OCD symptoms.},

  abstract = {Objective : To translate the PSI (Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory) into Turkish, to perform its cultural adaptation, to establish its reliability and validity, and to examine the prevalence of perceived pregnancy symptoms frequency and symptom-related limitation in Turkish pregnant women. Design : This cross-sectional study included healthy pregnant women over 18 years old from all 3 pregnancy trimesters. In the reliability analysis, the test-retest reliability was investigated by the Pearson correlation analysis. For the criterion validity of the PSI, correlations between the total pregnancy symptom frequency scores and the total scores of the Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Nottingham Health Profile were analyzed. Frequency and limitation perception prevalence of the symptoms were calculated as a percentage based on the response to each symptom. Statistical significance level was accepted as p\textexclamdown 0.05. Measurements and Findings : In the present study, 210 pregnant women participated, and 42 pregnant women filled out the Turkish-PSI twice for the test-retest analysis. In the frequency and limitation sections of the PSI, the test-retest correlations for each symptom were found to vary between medium and very strong (0.42\textendash 1.00 and 0.39\textendash 1.00, p \textexclamdown 0.05, respectively). Moderate correlations (rho = 0.39\textendash 0.58, p \textexclamdown 0.05, p {$\leq$} 0.001) were detected between the frequency section total score and the total scores of the other scales. The top four symptoms indicated as ``often'' by the Turkish pregnant women were urinary frequency (42.4\%), fatigue/tiredness (28.6\%), increased vaginal discharge (26.7\%), and upper/lower back pain (23.8\%). Key conclusions : The Turkish-PSI is a comprehensive, reliable, and valid inventory for evaluating a wide range of pregnancy symptoms in Turkish pregnant women. Further studies are needed to examine the sensitivity of the Turkish-PSI to treatment-induced changes. Implications for practice : Comprehensive and practical symptom questioning tools such as the PSI during pregnancy can lead to the early detection of pregnancy symptoms and to initiate effective non-pharmacological interventions.},

Methods This was a secondary analysis of data collected from 1916 pregnant women who participated in the TRansgenerational Assessment of Children's Environmental Risk (TRACER) study in Kuwait, and had answered the Baseline Questionnaire and completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS). Logistic regression models were used to examine the association of depressive symptoms with baseline socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial indicators. Results The prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms, using a cut-off of EDS score {$\geq$} 10, was 20.1\%. Depressive symptoms were reported more by women of lower family income and had self-reported history of depression prior to pregnancy, with women in the third trimester having higher odds of antenatal depressive symptoms compared to those in the second trimester. Pregnancy-related anxiety, higher perceived stress levels, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were comorbid with the presence of depressive symptoms. Conclusion The findings showed that one in five pregnant women in Kuwait experiences antenatal depressive symptoms and that these symptoms are comorbid with other mental health problems. Screening for antenatal depression and providing support to pregnant women should be considered.},

  abstract = {Background Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker that is affected by older age, psychosocial stress, and medical comorbidities. Despite the relevance of these factors to obstetric practice, little is known about LTL in pregnancy. Our study explored longitudinal LTL dynamics in pregnant and non-pregnant people. Objective This pilot study compares changes in LTL between pregnant and non-pregnant people over time, explores potential correlations between LTL and mental health measures, and investigates associations between short first-trimester LTL and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Study design This was a prospective pilot cohort study of nulliparous pregnant and non-pregnant people between ages 18 and 50 who presented for care at a single institution from January to November 2020. Pregnant people were enrolled between 10 and 14 weeks gestation. Participants had two blood samples drawn for LTL; the first on the day of enrollment and the second on postpartum day 1 (pregnant cohort) or 7 months later (non-pregnant cohort). LTL was measured using quantitative PCR. The primary outcome was the difference between pregnant and non-pregnant people in LTL change between the two timepoints (basepair difference per 30-day period). Secondary outcomes included differences in responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and a survey about stress related to COVID-19. Differences in LTL were tested using t-tests and linear regression models, both crude and adjusted for age. A subgroup analysis was conducted within the pregnant cohort to examine whether shorter first-trimester LTL was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted t-tests to compare LTL between people with and without each categorical outcome and computed Pearson correlation coefficients between LTL and continuous outcomes such as gestational age at delivery. Results 46 pregnant and 30 non-pregnant people were enrolled; 44 pregnant and 18 non-pregnant people completed all LTL assessments. There were no between-group differences in LTL change (-4.2 {$\pm$} 22.2 bp per 30 days pregnant versus -6.4 {$\pm$} 11.2 bp per 30 days non-pregnant, adjusted beta 2.1, 95\% CI -9.0-13.2, p = 0.60). The prevalence of depression and pandemic-related stress were both low overall. The two groups did not differ in PHQ-9 scores, and no correlations were significant between LTL and PHQ-9 scores. Among the 44 pregnant people, shorter first-trimester LTL was significantly correlated with earlier gestational age at delivery (r = 0.35, p = 0.02). Conclusion In this exploratory pilot cohort of reproductive-aged people with low levels of psychological stress, we described baseline changes in LTL over time in pregnant and non-pregnant participants. We found a correlation between shorter first-trimester LTL and earlier gestational age at delivery, which warrants further investigation in a larger cohort.},

  abstract = {The incidence of stress and stress-related disorders with the transition to motherhood, such as postpartum depression, is estimated to be 20\%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are currently the antidepressant of choice to treat maternal mood disorders. However, little is known about the effects of these medications on the maternal brain and behavior. Therefore, the present study investigated how a commonly used SSRI, fluoxetine, affects neurobehavioral outcomes in the mother using a model of maternal adversity. To do this, gestationally stressed and non-stressed Sprague-Dawley rat dams were treated with either fluoxetine (5mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Dams were divided into four groups: (1) Control+Vehicle, (2) Control+Fluoxetine, (3) Stress+Vehicle and (4) Stress+Fluoxetine. Fluoxetine or vehicle was administered to the dam during the postpartum period via osmotic minipump implants (Alzet) for 28 days. Results show that chronic fluoxetine treatment, after exposure to gestational stress, significantly decreased serum levels of corticosteroid binding globulin and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. In the absence of maternal stress, fluoxetine treatment alone significantly increased maternal arched-back nursing of pups, increased anxiety-related behavior, and decreased serum levels of corticosterone and corticosteroid binding globulin in the dam. This research provides important information on how SSRIs may act on the behavior, physiology, and neural plasticity of the mother. Although this is a first step in investigating the role of antidepressant treatment on the mother, much more work is needed before we can understand and improve the efficacy of these medications to treat mood disorders in pregnant and postpartum women.},

Summary Background Each woman experiences childbirth differently. Childbirth can be a positive or a very painful and stressful experience. Many factors can influence pregnancy and the experience of labor. Among these factors, fear of childbirth is known to be an important factor in childbirth outcomes. It may have an effect on labor pain, on the increase of pain relief, on planned caesarean requests and on the development of postpartum depression. Fear of childbirth appears to be more common among nulliparous women, but all pregnant women may have a fear of childbirth (Toohill et al., 2014; Salmela-Aro et al., 2012). Women with both anxiety and depression have the highest prevalence of fear of childbirth but some women with fear of childbirth have no symptoms of anxiety and/or depression (Storksen et al., 2012). Optimism is a trait which may vary over time. When people prepare to confront a difficulty, their state of confidence may be altered, therefore long term stability in optimism is not always high (Carver et al., 2010). Optimism confers benefits on what people are able to achieve (Scheier \& Carver, 1992), so it may affect women's perceptions of their ability to cope with labor. Research into fear of childbirth focuses on risk factors but also on protective factors such as optimism (Gourounti et al., 2015). There are, however, inconsistencies in the literature; causes of fear of childbirth are not completely understood. Furthermore, little is known about how positive psychological factors may protect against fear of childbirth. This exploratory study aimed to determine the impact of optimism and anxiety on the fear of childbirth. We were interested in exploring if anxiety is a risk factor for fear of childbirth and if optimism is a protective factor. Methods Participants were recruited through maternity care services and maternity care providers' offices in the South of France. Ninety-two pregnant women participated in the study. Among them, 54 were primiparous and 38 were multiparous. Participants' average age was 30 years (21\textendash 42). All participants were in their third trimester; the duration of pregnancy was from 7 to 9 months. They were asked to complete a set of questionnaires regarding their psychological and gynecological history, their experience of pregnancy (anamnestic survey), their fear of childbirth (the Fear of Childbirth Scale; EPA), their antenatal anxiety and depression symptoms (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), their optimism level (the Life Orientation Test\textendash Revised; LOT-R) and their satisfaction of life (the Life Satisfaction Scale; ESDV). Results The level of fear of childbirth was high in this sample (mean score EPA=63.48). Results indicated that factors promoting fear of childbirth were primiparity, medical complications during pregnancy and the presence of anxiety symptoms. In fact, primiparous women were more likely to experience fear of childbirth than multiparous women (mean score EPA=67.63 vs 57.58; P\textexclamdown.01). Women who had complications during pregnancy had higher scores than those without complications (mean score EPA=71.06 vs 59.80; P\textexclamdown.01). Women with anxiety symptoms had higher fear of childbirth scores than those without anxiety symptoms (mean score EPA=68.90 vs 58.39; P\textexclamdown.01). Fear of childbirth was associated with anxiety symptoms in thirty-eight women (41.30\%). Variance in fear of childbirth scores was explained in part by anxiety and optimism. Anxiety mediated the relationship between optimism and fear of childbirth. Conclusion Anxiety acts as a buffer between optimism and fear of childbirth. A greater understanding of the role of anxiety in the development or in maintenance of fear of childbirth in pregnant women was gained. This current research suggests that clinical interventions which aim to reduce fear of childbirth should pay attention to anxiety symptoms before trying to develop positive strategies such as optimism. Future research should attempt to replicate these findings with a follow-up assessment. Multiple benefits could result when treating fear of childbirth. In fact, decrease in fear of childbirth among pregnant women could positively impact the quality of labor as well as the transition to motherhood and mother\textendash infant bonding.},

  abstract = {Background Globally, depression is prevalent during pregnancy and several factors have been associated with antenatal depressive symptoms (ADS). However, ADS have rarely been investigated in Thailand. This study aimed at exploring the prevalence of ADS and factors associated with these symptoms among Thai women in late pregnancy. Methods A cross-sectional study including 449 women in late pregnancy was carried out. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to detect depressive symptoms with a score of 10 points or higher. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial risks were measured in association with ADS. Percentage and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the prevalence of ADS. Odds ratio (OR) and 95\%CI were used to determine ADS-related risk factors among women. Results The prevalence of ADS was 46.8\% (95\%CI 42.3\textendash 51.4). Pregnant women aged less than 20 years (OR 2.58, 95\%CI 1.14\textendash 5.84) and those not having enough money (OR 2.71, 95\%CI 1.22\textendash 6.05) had an increased risk of ADS. Psychosocial risks related to ADS for women were low psychological well-being (OR 3.12, 95\%CI 1.75\textendash 5.58), low self-esteem (OR 2.08, 95\%CI 1.24\textendash 3.49), and low sense of coherence (OR 1.82, 95\%CI 1.12\textendash 2.95). Conclusions The prevalence of ADS among Thai women in their late pregnancy is high. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial factors are independently associated with ADS. Healthcare providers in Thailand should consider EPDS as a standardised screening tool for ADS and use it at antenatal care clinics. Implementing programs focusing on both pregnant women and their family might increase the prevention of perinatal depression.},

  abstract = {Summary Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in youth. About a third to one-half of the affected subjects continue to have symptoms in adulthood. Remarkably, the prevalence numbers published for adult females are higher than for girls. The differences in the epidemiological data between the age groups clearly point to underdiagnosed ADHD in girls. Major depression, the most frequent psychiatric condition worldwide in adulthood, is twice as common in female as in male adults. Anxiety and depression are also among the most common comorbidities in adults with ADHD. Therefore, an undiagnosed ADHD may often underlie the psychopathology in depressive women. Another possibly associated phenomenon is the increased frequency of smoking in adult females. Since nicotine indirectly enhances the intrasynaptic dopamine level which presumably is too low both in ADHD and in depression, smoking might be used as a self-medication in women with untreated ADHD and consecutive depression. Furthermore, smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for ADHD in the offspring, so the vicious circle is complete. Depression in mothers of children with ADHD is associated with a higher rate of comorbidity in the children. Improved screening for ADHD in girls and treatment in childhood might thus reduce the rate of depression and smoking in adult females. We hypothesize that earlier identification and interventions might not only improve the lives of millions of girls and women but might also reduce the prevalence rates in future generations or at least moderate the deviant behaviour in this highly heritable disorder in which the development and severity of symptoms and the functional impairment depend to a high degree on epigenetic factors.}

Furthermore, non-maternal hospitalizations demonstrated a greater prevalence of depression and/or anxiety diagnoses compared to maternal hospitalizations over the same time period (21\textbullet 7\% versus 2\textbullet 8\%). Among all female hospitalizations, whites were roughly twice as likely as minorities to have a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety.

  abstract = {Summary Background Parents have faced substantial social and economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level. Methods In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. Findings Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35{$\cdot$}21\%, 95\% CI 32{$\cdot$}48\textendash 38{$\cdot$}04) and anxiety symptoms (31{$\cdot$}39\%, 28{$\cdot$}76\textendash 34{$\cdot$}15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8{$\cdot$}31, 95\% CI 7{$\cdot$}97\textendash 8{$\cdot$}65) and anxiety score (11{$\cdot$}90, 11{$\cdot$}66\textendash 12{$\cdot$}13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5{$\cdot$}05, 4{$\cdot$}85\textendash 5{$\cdot$}25; mean anxiety score 9{$\cdot$}51, 9{$\cdot$}35\textendash 9{$\cdot$}66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5{$\cdot$}43, 5{$\cdot$}20\textendash 5{$\cdot$}66; mean anxiety score 9{$\cdot$}49, 9{$\cdot$}33\textendash 9{$\cdot$}65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5{$\cdot$}79, 5{$\cdot$}55\textendash 6{$\cdot$}02; mean anxiety score 10{$\cdot$}26, 10{$\cdot$}10\textendash 10{$\cdot$}42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2{$\cdot$}30 points (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}95\textendash 2{$\cdot$}65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1{$\cdot$}04 points (0{$\cdot$}65\textendash 1{$\cdot$}43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. Interpretation Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

  abstract = {Background Evidence on whether anxiety or mood disorders increases the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) has been conflicting. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of maternal mental disorders over time and their associations with HDP. Methods This was a population-based retrospective study involving 9,097,355 pregnant women using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) data from 2004 through 2014. We calculated the prevalence of maternal anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and mood disorder and trends of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia during the study period. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between each mental disorder and HDP. Results Mental disorders showed increasing trends among pregnant women, with anxiety showing the greatest increase in rates. Unadjusted associations suggest all mental disorders increase the likelihood of HDP. When adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, only anxiety showed consistently increased risk of gestational hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.324, 95\% CI 1.255-1.397), preeclampsia (aOR 1.522, 95\% CI 1.444-1.604), with the strongest association with eclampsia (aOR 1.813, 95\% CI 1.260-2.610). Limitations Information on medication use is not available in the HCUP-NIS database and might have been contributory to our findings. Conclusions Rates of maternal psychopathology are rising in the United States. Our study suggests that pregnant women with anxiety are at increased risk of HDP. Targeted screening for mental disorders as possible clinical risk markers may allow for timely prophylaxis and surveillance for the development of HDP.},

  abstract = {Premesse La gravidanza \`e considerata un periodo di serenit\`a per la donna, tuttavia essa non rappresenta un fattore protettivo per la depressione perinatale, i cui tassi di prevalenza variano tra l'8,5\% e l'11,0\% in gravidanza e tra il 6,5\% e il 12,9\% nel primo anno post partum. Solo una piccola percentuale dei casi viene identificata, sia perch\'e alcuni sintomi vengono erroneamente attribuiti allo stato di gravidanza, sia perch\'e molte donne, nel tentativo di evitare lo stigma, prefericono ``soffrire in silenzio''. Discussione e conclusioni Dati recenti suggeriscono che uno screening precoce pu\`o identificare le donne a pi\`u alto rischio per la presenza di alcuni fattori, tra cui una storia personale e familiare positiva per depressione, la presenza di ansia in gravidanza, uno scarso supporto sociale. A oggi, sono stati sviluppati solo pochi interventi preventivi standardizzati per ridurre l'impatto di questa patologia. Il trattamento si basa pi\`u sull'esperienza clinica che sulla presenza di specifiche linee guida internazionali: in caso di depressione lieve il primo intervento dovrebbe essere rappresentato dai trattamenti non farmacologici (psicoterapia di supporto, psicoterapia interpersonale breve o cognitivo-comportamentale); nei casi di depressione da moderata a grave \`e consigliato l'uso di antidepressivi, prevalentemente inibitori selettivi della ricaptazione della serotonina o triciclici, valutando il bilancio fra sicurezza ed efficacia e tenendo in considerazione anche la precedente risposta a una specifica molecola. Background Although pregnancy is considered a period of wellbeing for the woman, it is not a protective factor against perinatal depression; prevalence rates of depression range from 8.5\% and 11\% during pregnancy, and from 6.5\% and 12.9\% during the first year post-partum. Only few cases are identified, on one hand because many symptoms of depression are interpreted as an effect of pregnancy itself, and on the other hand, because many pregnant women, to avoid a possibile ``stigma'', prefer a ``silent suffering''. Discussion and conclusions Recent data suggest that an early screening could detect women at the highest risk to develop perinatal depression, for the presence of risk factors such as a personal or family history of depression, anxiety during pregnancy, lack of social support. Today, only few standardized preventive interventions have been developed to reduce the impact of this pathology. Treatment is based on clinical experience, rather than on specific international guidelines: for mild depression the first intervention should be a psychotherapy (counselling, interpersonal or cognitive-behavioral therapy); for moderate to severe depression, prescription of a pharmachological treatment should be considered (antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants), weighting risks and efficacy, and taking into account a previous positive response to a specific pharmachological agent.},

  abstract = {Background Australian clinical practice guidelines support comprehensive psychosocial assessment as a routine component of maternity care. Aim To examine the concurrent and predictive validity of the Antenatal Risk Questionnaire-Revised (ANRQ-R) when used across the perinatal period. Methods Women completed the ANRQ-R and a diagnostic reference standard (SAGE-SR) in the second and third trimesters and at 3-months postpartum. ANRQ-R test performance for cut-off scores at each time-point was assessed using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Findings Overall sample sizes were N=1166 (second trimester), N=957 (third trimester) and N=796 (3-month postpartum). 6.5\%, 5.6\% and 6.2\% of women met SAGE-SR criteria for any depressive or anxiety disorder at these time-points (`cases'), respectively. ROC analysis yielded acceptable areas under the curve (AUC) when the ANRQ-R was used to detect current (AUC=0.789-0.798) or predict future (AUC=0.705-0.789) depression or anxiety. Using an example cut-off score of 18 or more, the ANRQ-R correctly classified 72\textendash 76\% of concurrent `cases' and `non-cases' (sensitivity=0.70-0.74, specificity=0.72-0.76) and correctly predicted 74\textendash 78\% of postnatal `cases' and `non-cases' (sensitivity=0.52-0.72, specificity=0.75-0.79). Completion of the ANRQ-R earlier in pregnancy yielded greater positive likelihood ratios for predicting depression or anxiety at 3-months postpartum (cut-off {$\geq$}18: second trimester=3.8; third trimester=2.2). Conclusion The ANRQ-R is a structured psychosocial assessment questionnaire that can be scored to provide an overall measure of psychosocial risk. Cut-off scores need not be uniform across settings. Such decisions should be guided by factors including diagnostic prevalence rates, local needs and resource availability.},

Methods Youth risk behavior survey questionnaires were collected from 2311 adolescents in 8 schools, 13 communities and 2 Juvenile Home Institutions from January to February 2001. Their mean age was 15.5 {$\pm$} 1.8 years, and 59\% were female. Risk factors of interest were gender, parental marital status, socioeconomic status, family relationship, parental drug addiction, peer group, loneliness, self-esteem, and school performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors associated with each risk behavior. Results The risk behaviors leading to traffic accidents were rarely or never having worn a seat belt (30.6\%) or helmet while bicycling (66.9\%) and while motorcycling (50.1\%), riding with drivers who had consumed alcohol (18.8\%), and driving after consuming alcohol (12.1\%). The studied group carried weapons (8.5\%) and has been involved in a violent event (31.5\%). Among 13.9\% who were assaulted, 6.7\% needed hospitalization; rape was reported by 2.4\%. Depression was reported by 19.9\%, with 12\% having suicidal tendencies and 8\% attempting suicide. The lifetime use vs. heavy use prevalence of substance abuse, respectively, was: 15.4\% and 3.5\% for smoking, 37.3\% and 1.7\% for alcohol, 37.8\% and 4.6\% for amphetamine use, and 37.9\% and 0.1\% for other drugs. Among the 10\% who have had sexual intercourse, 1\% were homosexual, 7.1\% have never used a condom, and 2.1\% resulted in pregnancy. Being male was a risk factor for every untoward behavior except depression. Other risk factors included poor self-esteem, poor school performance, and early school leaving. Factors relating to the family included a low socioeconomic status, poor relationships, broken families, and parental substance abuse. Socioenvironmental factors included being in a gang and loneliness. Some risk behaviors started at younger than 8 years old. Schools and media were given as the sources of information regarding sex, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and substance abuse. Conclusions The prevalence of six major-risk behaviors in adolescents in Bangkok was significantly high. Several risk factors were identified, the knowledge from which may help to form preventive measures in this population.},

We compared the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms between women seeking for infertility treatment and women who conceived after ART or naturally. Methods Four hundred and sixty-eight sub-fertile non-pregnant women, 2972 naturally pregnant women and 143 women pregnant after ART completed a questionnaire in this cross-sectional study. The Anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A{$\geq$}8) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS{$\geq$}12) were used for assessing anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to explore associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among sub-fertile, non-pregnant women (57.6\% and 15.7\%, respectively) were significantly higher compared to women pregnant after ART (21.1\% and 8.5\%, respectively) and naturally pregnant women (18.8\% and 10.3\%, respectively). History of psychiatric diagnosis was identified as an independent risk factor for both anxiety and depressive symptoms. The presence of at least one unhealthy lifestyle behavior (daily tobacco smoking, weekly alcohol consumption, BMI{$\geq$}25, and regular physical exercise\textexclamdown 2h/week) was also associated with anxiety (Prevalence Ratio, PR: 1.24; 95\%CI: 1.09\textendash 1.40) and depressive symptoms (PR: 1.25; 95\%CI: 1.04\textendash 1.49). Conclusions Women pregnant after ART showed no difference in anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to naturally pregnant women.

This study aimed to assess critical periods when maternal symptoms would be more deleterious. Methods Cohort of 4231 births followed-up in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. Mood symptoms during pregnancy were self-reported by mothers at perinatal interview; and at 3-months postpartum, mothers answered the Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Psychiatric disorders in 6-year-old children were evaluated through the Development and Well-Being Assessment instrument. Odds ratios with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated by logistic regression. Results Prevalence of mood symptoms in pregnancy was 24.6\% (23.2\textendash 26.0\%) and at three months postpartum 22.5\% (21.1\textendash 23.9\%). Prevalence of mental disorders in children was 13.3\% (12.2\textendash 14.4\%). After adjustment for confounders children of mothers with mood symptoms during pregnancy were 82\% more likely of presenting psychiatric disorders than children of mothers that did not (1.82; 1.48\textendash 2.25); and the chance of having mental disorders among children whose mothers had positive SRQ-20 at three months postpartum was 87\% greater than the observed among children whose mothers had it negative (1.87; 1.50\textendash 2.33). Limitations Because maternal anxiety/depression may interfere with interpretation of the child behavior, child׳s mental health being obtained by interviewing the mother is a limitation of this study. Lack of information on other risk factors may have lead to residual confounding on the effect of maternal mood symptoms at three months postpartum. Conclusions Children of mothers presenting mood symptoms during pregnancy and in the first months postpartum are more likely to present psychiatric disorders at 6 years of age.},

  abstract = {Objectives To assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health problems in a cohort of women in early pregnancy. To describe the relationship between poor mental health and sociodemographic characteristics, self-efficacy and support networks. To assess if participants were representative of the local antenatal population. Research design and setting The UK government has pledged money to provide more support for women with perinatal mental health issues. Understanding the prevalence and predicting women who may need support will inform clinical practice. This paper reports part of the larger `Mothers Mood Study', which explored women's and midwives' experience of mild to moderate perinatal mental health issues and service provision. Routinely collected population level data were analysed and a smaller cross-sectional survey design used to assess predictors of poor mental health in early pregnancy in one health board in Wales. Participants Routinely collected data were extracted for all women who registered for maternity care between May 2017 and May 2018 (n = 6312) from the electronic maternity information system (pregnant population). Over a three month period 302 of these women completed a questionnaire at the antenatal clinic after an ultrasound scan (participants). Eligible women were aged {$\geq$}18 years, with sufficient spoken and written English to complete the questionnaire and a viable pregnancy of {$\leq$}18 weeks' gestation. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic status, self-efficacy and support networks, self-reported mental health problems. Current anxiety and depression were assessed using the General Anxiety Disorders Assessment and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Findings Among the pregnant population 23\% (n = 1490) disclosed a mental health problem during routine questioning with anxiety and depression being the most common conditions. Participants completing the detailed questionnaire were similar in age and parity to the pregnant population with similar levels of depression (15.6\%; n = 15.6 v 17.3\%, n = 1092). Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and General Anxiety Disorder 7 scores identified 8\% with symptoms of anxiety (n = 25) or depression (n = 26) and a further 24.2\% (n = 73) with symptoms of mild anxiety and 25.2\% (n = 76) with mild depression. Low self-efficacy (OR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.12\textendash 1.45), a previous mental health problem (OR 3.95, 95\% CI 1.37\textendash 11.33) and low support from family (OR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.00\textendash 1.27) were found to be associated with early pregnancy anxiety and/or depression. Key conclusions and implications for practice Around one in five women who register for maternity care may have a mental health problem. Mild to moderate anxiety and depression are common in early pregnancy. Services need to improve for women who do not currently meet the threshold for referral to perinatal mental health services. Assessment and active monitoring of mental health is recommended, in particular for pregnant women with risk factors including a history of previous mental health difficulties, poor family support or low self-efficacy.},

We analyze a contemporary and comprehensive SCAD registry to advance the understanding of SCAD risk factors, angiographic appearance, and gender differences. This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively populated database of SCAD patients seen at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) between June 2013 and October 2017. Core laboratory analysis of both coronary angiograms and computerized tomographic (CT) angiography of the extracoronary vessels was performed. Of the 113 patients, 87\% were female and mean age was 47 {$\pm$} 10 years. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking were present in 27\%, 14\%, and 22\% of patients. Among females, 14\%, 8\%, and 9\% had a history of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes, respectively. Fifteen percent had used fertility treatment and 47\% of postmenopausal women had used hormone replacement therapy. Angiography showed multivessel SCAD in 42\%, severe coronary artery tortuosity in 59\%, and extracoronary vascular abnormalities in 100\% of patients with complete CT angiographic imaging. Gender differences revealed a self-reported depression and anxiety prevalence of 20\% and 32\%, respectively, in women compared with 0\% in men. Type 1 SCAD was more commonly diagnosed in men than women (71\% vs 29\%, p \textexclamdown 0.01). In conclusion, we highlight under-recognized features of SCAD including (1) relation with pregnancy complications and exposure to hormonal therapy; (2) diffuse, multivessel process in tortuous coronaries on a background of extracoronary arterial abnormalities; and (3) gender differences highlighting the role of mental health as well as potential underdiagnoses in men.}

  abstract = {Maternal depression has been intensively explored; however, less attention has been paid to maternal suicide. No studies to date have observed maternal depression and suicide at immediate prenatal and early postpartum stages. In total, 213 Chinese women were recruited in hospitals after they were admitted for childbirth. All completed a short-term longitudinal survey at perinatal stages. Women reported lower depression scores (6.65) and higher suicidal ideation incidence (11.74\%) after childbirth. Prenatal depression raised the possibility of prenatal suicidal ideation, while prenatal depression and suicidal ideation increased postpartum depression and suicidal ideation. At immediate prenatal stage, marital satisfaction protected women from depression, while miscarriage experiences and self-esteem increased the risk. At early postpartum stage, in contrast, being first-time mother, marital satisfaction, and harmony with mother-in-law prevented them from depression. Our study is among the first to confirm that women have decreased depression but increased suicidal ideation at early postpartum, and a causal relationship between them, which are worthy of public attention. Potential protective (marital satisfaction, being first-time mother, and harmony with mother-in-law) or risk factors (miscarriage experiences and self-esteem) of maternal depression and suicidal ideation are identified at perinatal stages. This offers reliable guidance for clinical practice of health care.},

Psychiatric illness is linked with obstetric complications along with impaired maternal functioning in the postpartum period. This article provides a comprehensive review of the research examining the intersection of psychopathology and adolescent pregnancy and the postpartum period. Design A literature search was conducted using PubMed (Medline), PsycINFO, and CINAHL for articles published between 1990 and 2013 that examined depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and psychosis during pregnancy and the postpartum period in adolescents age 21 years or younger. Articles were selected that covered the following topics: Prevalence or incidence, comorbidity, psychosocial correlates, birth outcomes, parenting, child outcomes, and psychosocial treatment. Forty articles were found and reviewed. Results There is a substantial research base examining self-reported depressive symptoms in adolescents during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Existing research suggests that pregnant and parenting adolescents are at greater risk for experiencing depressive symptoms than pregnant and postpartum adult women. Depression in the perinatal period is also a risk factor for substance and alcohol abuse and a harsher parenting style in adolescents. Areas for future research in this population include investigating the prevalence, psychosocial correlates, and outcomes of clinically diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder, developing and empirically validating psychotherapeutic treatments, and focusing upon other psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, and psychosis.},

  abstract = {Objective We aimed to analyze the changing level of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women, with and without high-risk indicators separately, in a tertiary care center serving also for COVID-19 patients, in the capital of Turkey. Study design We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited. Results There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05). Conclusion High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.},

Design Prospective cohort study using longitudinal urine measurements of common SSRIs while women are actively trying to conceive. Setting Four clinical sites. Patient(s) A total of 1,228 women without uncontrolled depression/anxiety, attempting natural conception while participating in a randomized trial of preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin. Interventions(s) Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s) Urinary SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram/citalopram) were measured while trying to conceive and, for women who became pregnant, at weeks 0, 4, and 8 of pregnancy. Fecundability odds ratios and incidence of pregnancy loss and live birth were estimated. Result(s) A total of 172 women (14\%) were exposed to SSRIs while trying to conceive. SSRI exposure was associated with 24\% reduced fecundability, and accordingly, a nonsignificant 9\% lower live birth incidence, with significantly lower live birth in fluoxetine-exposed women. SSRI exposure was not associated with subsequent pregnancy loss, whether exposure was before conception or at 0, 4, or 8 weeks of gestation, although estimates varied by specific SSRI drug. Conclusion(s) Women using SSRIs may have more difficulty becoming pregnant, and although SSRI exposure overall was not associated with pregnancy loss, fluoxetine deserves caution and future study.

  abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the serotonin (5-HT) reuptake transporter (SERT) and increase synaptic 5-HT. 5-HT is also important in brain development; hence when SSRIs are taken during pregnancy there exists the potential for these drugs to affect CNS ontogeny. Prenatal SSRI exposure has been associated with an increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and peripheral 5-HT is elevated in some ASD patients. Perinatal SSRI exposure in rodents has been associated with increased depression and anxiety-like behavior, decreased sociability, and impaired learning in the offspring, behaviors often seen in ASD. The present study investigated whether perinatal exposure to citalopram causes persistent neurobehavioral effects. Gravid Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups and subcutaneously injected twice per day with citalopram (10mg/kg; Cit) or saline (Sal) 6h apart on embryonic day (E)6-21, and then drug was given directly to the pups after delivery from postnatal day (P)1-20. Starting on P60, one male/female from each litter was tested in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) and open-field before and after MK-801. A second pair from each litter was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and open-field before and after (+)-amphetamine. A third pair was tested as follows: elevated zero-maze, open-field, marble burying, prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, social preference, and forced swim. Cit-exposed rats were impaired in the MWM during acquisition and probe, but not during reversal, shift, or cued trials. Cit-exposed rats also showed increased marble burying, decreased time in the center of the open-field, decreased latency to immobility in forced swim, and increased acoustic startle across prepulse intensities with no effects on CWM. The results are consistent with citalopram inducing several ASD-like effects. The findings add to concerns about use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Further research on different classes of antidepressants, dose-effect relationships, timing of exposure periods, and mechanisms for these effects are needed. It is also important to balance the effects described here against the effects of the disorders for which the drugs are given.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The US Food and Drug Administration increasingly uses administrative databases to conduct surveillance of medications used during pregnancy. To assess adverse fetal effects, administrative records must be linked between the mother and infant. The Sentinel Initiative's Mother-Infant Linkage Table provides a large cohort of linked deliveries from national, regional, and public insurance claims in the United States for the US Food and Drug Administration to conduct surveillance. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe baseline health conditions and prescription medication use during pregnancy in cohorts of women with a live-birth delivery linked and not linked to an infant. STUDY DESIGN Live-birth deliveries in women aged 10 to 54 years with at least 391 days of medical and drug coverage before delivery were identified in the Sentinel Mother-Infant Linkage Table from 2000 to 2019. Two cohorts were created for analysis: deliveries linked to infant records (linked deliveries, n=2,320,805) and deliveries unable to be linked to an infant (not-linked deliveries, n=504,785). Baseline health conditions, pregnancy history, healthcare utilization, and pregnancy conditions were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes. Medication exposure was identified in a 90-day prepregnancy period and in each trimester. RESULTS Few notable differences were observed between the linked and not-linked deliveries except for maternal age and preterm birth; the not-linked cohort was 3.4 years younger on average and more likely to have a preterm delivery. At baseline among the linked deliveries, the most common conditions were depression and anxiety (5.2\% each), acquired hypothyroidism (5.0\%), pain conditions (3.9\%), and asthma (2.8\%). Among linked deliveries, 6.9\% had evidence of gestational diabetes mellitus, 3.9\% had gestational hypertension, and 4.5\% had preeclampsia or eclampsia. The most commonly used medications during pregnancy in the linked deliveries were antibacterials (41.6\%) and antiemetics (21.5\%); similar medication use patterns were observed in the not-linked cohort. Age trends were observed for some medication groups; anti-infectives, pain medications, and antiemetics were more common in younger mothers, whereas endocrine medications were more common in older mothers. CONCLUSION Similarities between the linked and not-linked cohorts suggested that the ability to link mother and infant records is not influenced by maternal health status. In the linked cohort, the prevalence of specific pregnancy complications and medication use were similar to previously reported national estimates. Some baseline comorbidities, such as obesity and smoking, may be underestimated in the Sentinel Mother-Infant Linkage.},

Objective The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of a positive postpartum depression screen in a specialty postpartum perineal clinic, and (2) identify risk factors for postpartum depression in this population. Study Design A retrospective chart review was performed of 294 women referred to a specialty postpartum perineal clinic at the University of Michigan from March 30, 2012, through May 3, 2016. Women who completed a new patient intake form, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were included. The prevalence of a positive Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screen ({$\geq$}10) was determined. Bivariate analyses were used to compare demographics, delivery characteristics, referral indications, and postpartum pelvic floor symptoms between women with and without a positive Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screen. Significant variables identified in the analyses were then used to perform logistic regression to identify factors independently associated with a positive Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screen. Results In all, 15.6\% (46/294) of women had a positive postpartum depression screen. Average age was 30.6 {$\pm$} 4.8 years, average body mass index was 28.9 {$\pm$} 5.06 kg/m2, 68.0\% (200/294) were Caucasian, 79.6\% (234/294) were primiparous, and 86.0\% (245/285) were breast-feeding. Using multivariable logistic regression, women with a positive postpartum depression screen had higher odds of being non-Caucasian (adjusted odds ratio, 2.72; 95\% confidence interval, 1.27\textendash 5.832; P = .01), having a history of depression and/or anxiety (adjusted odds ratio, 2.77; 95\% confidence interval, 1.23\textendash 6.24; P = .01), having been referred for pain (adjusted odds ratio, 2.61; 95\% confidence interval, 1.24\textendash 5.49; P = .01), and reporting urinary incontinence during and after pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 3.81; 95\% confidence interval, 1.57\textendash 9.25; P = .003). Conclusion Urinary incontinence during and after pregnancy and referral for pain were pelvic floor symptoms independently associated with a positive postpartum depression screen in women referred to a specialty perineal clinic. Therefore, consideration should be given to depression screening in women presenting with perinatal urinary incontinence and persistent postpartum pain, as these women may be at increased risk of developing postpartum depression.},

Methods A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at maternity facilities in Setagaya area of Tokyo, Japan. Of the 1775 women who participated, 1311 women met the inclusion criteria of this analysis. All data, including EPDS, were collected via self-administrated questionnaires at 20 weeks' gestation and at 5 time points postpartum, from the first few days to 3 months postpartum. We divided EPDS items into three factors: ``anxiety,'' ``anhedonia,'' and ``depression,'' according to factor analysis. Results The prevalence of individuals exhibiting depressive symptoms, EPDS total score, and each factor score peaked at two weeks postpartum in primiparas (EPDS total = 5.58, anhedonia = 0.47, anxiety = 2.64, and depression = 1.23). In contrast, the EPDS total score and factor scores for ``anxiety'' and ``depression'' gradually decreased for multiparas, from the prenatal to postpartum period (EPDS total 3.33, 3.03, 3.03, 2.72, 2.76, and 2.37). Limitations Each factor score was not weighted; instead, we simply added up the item scores ranging from 0 to 3 for each question. Additionally, the population representativeness of Japanese women was not high, although the sample was population-based and had a high follow-up rate.

Patients We included women planning to conceive within a year. We excluded women who were pregnant, taking chemotherapy or psychotropic medications, had diabetes mellitus, received assisted fertility interventions or contraception, did not conceive after 12 months, with multiple pregnancies, or who developed obstetric complications. Interventions None. Measurements We investigated the relationship between average pain score during the three days after childbirth (primary exposure) and incidence of SAPC at postpartum three months (primary outcome).

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of maternal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy and provide scientific basis for reducing prenatal mental disorders. Methods Data were obtained from 1220 women with \textexclamdown{} 15 weeks gestation in a cohort study conducted in Chongqing, China. Prenatal stress, anxiety and depression were assessed using the pregnancy pressure scale, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale, respectively. Results The prevalence of prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy was 91.86\%, 15.04\% and 5.19\%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for prenatal stress include housewife/unemployment, presence of anxiety and low- and moderate-level social support, besides, the protective factors were exercise, active smoking and no suggestion from parents. Housewife/unemployment, primiparity, presence of stress and depression and low-level social support were found to be associated with the development of anxiety symptoms, whereas exercise had a protective effect on it. Group-oriented personality, presence of anxiety, no suggestion from husband, low- and moderate-level family care, and low-level social support were risk factors for prenatal depression. Limitations All participants were recruited from one region of China, and none of them have a history of cesarean section. Conclusion Early screening and intervention may have great significance for reducing mental disorders of pregnant women, and the family and society support should be brought into the intervention as well.},

  abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of suicide risk and comorbidities in postpartum women. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of postpartum women. The sample comprised mothers who have received prenatal care from the Brazilian National System of Public Heath in the city of Pelotas. Suicide risk and other mental disorders were evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). A yes answer on one of the six interview questions was considered a sign of suicide risk. Results The sample consisted of 919 postpartum women. The 11.5\% suicide prevalence was 4.62 (CI 2.45, 8.73) times higher in women with low educational levels. Women with comorbid depression or an anxiety disorder showed a 17.04 (CI 2.27; 19.96) times greater risk of suicide than those who did not suffer from any mood disorder. Conclusion Lower education levels and psychiatric disorders are associated with suicide risk. Bipolar disorder is the psychiatric disorder with the highest impact on suicide risk.

Les objectifs de cette \'etude consistent \`a \'evaluer, dans les premiers jours apr\`es l'accouchement, la valeur du seuil pr\'edictif d'une d\'epression du post-partum avec l'EPDS et de pr\'eciser son seuil pour le d\'epistage des d\'epressions majeures du post-partum. Les passations ont \'et\'e r\'ealis\'ees en 2 temps aupr\`es de m\`eres primipares et multipares dans 3 cliniques priv\'ees obst\'etricales du sud-ouest de la France.

Tout d'abord, l'\'echelle EPDS a \'et\'e remplie par 859 m\`eres au 3e jour apr\`es leur accouchement. Puis, 722 m\`eres ont \`a nouveau rempli cette \'echelle entre la 4e et la 6e semaine du post-partum. Parmi ces 722 m\`eres, 131 pr\'esentaient une d\'epression du post-partum. Le diagnostic de d\'epression a \'et\'e corrobor\'e par la Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1972), l'\'echelle de d\'epression de Hamilton (HDRS, Hamilton, 1967) et le MINI (Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, Lecrubier et al. 1997). Au 3e jour post-partum, nous notons 30 \% de m\`eres dont les scores EPDS sont9 et 19 \% dont les scores EPDS sont11. Entre la 4e et la 6e semaine post-partum, nous observons 18,1 \% de d\'epression du post-partum, dont 16,8 \% de d\'epression majeure du post-partum. Les analyses factorielles indiquent, au 3e jour du post-partum, une structure compos\'ee de 2 sous-\'echelles, et dans l'\'evaluation de la d\'epression du post-partum une structure monofactorielle. L'\'etude de la sensibilit\'e et de la sp\'ecificit\'e au 3e jour post-partum pr\'evoit le score de 9 (sensibilit\'e : 0,88) (sp\'ecificit\'e : 0,50) comme la valeur du seuil pr\'edictif de d\'epression post-partum. L'\'etude de la sensibilit\'e et de la sp\'ecificit\'e entre la 4e et la 6e semaine post-partum pr\'evoit un seuil de 12 pour le d\'epistage des d\'epressions majeures du post-partum (sensibilit\'e : 0,91 et sp\'ecificit\'e : 0,74).

Summary The postpartum is a high-risk period for the occurrence of anxious and depressive episodes. Indeed, during the first few days after delivery, mothers can present postpartum blues symptomatology : fatigue, anxiety, disordered sleeping and a changing mood. Postpartum depression is characterised by a changing mood, anxiety, irritability, depression, panic and obsessional phenomena. It occurs in approximately 10 to 20 \% mothers. The exact prevalence depending on the criteria used for detection. The first symptoms usually appear between the fourth and sixth week postpartum. However, postpartum depression can start from the moment of birth, or may result from depression evolving continuously since pregnancy. We can add that the intensity of postpartum blues is a risk factor that can perturb maternal development. So it is important for health professionals to dispose of predictive tools. This study is a validation of the French version of the EPDS. The aims of the study were to evaluate the postpartum depression predictive value at 3 days postpartum and to determine a cut-off score for major depression. Subjects participating in this study were met in 3 obstetrical clinics in, or in the vicinity of, Toulouse. Mothers with psychological problems, under treatment for psychological problems or mothers whose babies present serious health problems were excluded from the study. The EPDS was presented to 859 mothers (mean age = 30.3 ; SD = 4.5) met at one of the clinics at 3 days postpartum (period 1). They had an EPDS mean score of 6.4 (SD = 4.6) ; 258 (30 \%) mothers had an EPDS score {$\geq$}9. 82.6 \% of these mothers experienced a natural childbirth and 17.3 \% a caesarean section ; 51.5 \% gave birth to their first child, 36.2 \% to their second child and 12.3 \% to their third or more. All subjects were given a second EPDS with written instructions to complete the scale during the period 4 to 6 weeks postpartum and return it for analysis (period 2). Between the 4 to 6 weeks postpartum period, 722 mothers replied again to the EPDS. 131 mothers had an EPDS score {$\geq$}11 (mean age = 30.3 ; SD = 4.8). They had an EPDS mean score of 13.6 (SD = 3.3). Mothers with probable depression were interviewed and assessed, using the Mini (Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, Lecrubier et al. 1997), the SIGH-D (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale) and the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) in order to diagnose a major depressive episode. They had a HDRS mean score of 13.7 (SD = 5.1) and a BDI mean score of 13.6 (SD = 5). At 3 days postpartum, we observed that 258 mothers (30 \%) had an EPDS scores{$\geq$}9 and 164 mothers (19 \%) had an EPDS scores{$\geq$}11. Between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum, we observed 18.1 \% of postpartum depression (EPDS{$\geq$}11) and 16.8 \% (EPDS{$\geq$}12) of major postpartum depression. The analysis of the sensitivity and the specificity at 3 days postpartum provides a cut-off score of 9 (Sensibility : 0.88) (Specificity : 0.50) as predictive of postpartum depression, for this cut-off score, the type I error is low (5.8 \%) but the type II error is more higher (18.9 \%). The analysis of the sensitivity and the specificity between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum provides a cut-off score of 12 (Sensibility : 0.91) (Sensibility : 0.74) for the detection of major postpartum depression. Factor analysis shows at 3 days postpartum that the internal structure of the scale is composed of two subscales. The first factor F1 \guillemotleft{} anxiety \guillemotright{} accounts 28 \% of the variance and the second factor F2 \guillemotleft{} depression \guillemotright{} accounts 20 \% of the variance. Between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum, factor analysis suggests an unidimensional model in the evaluation of postpartum depression which is better than a two factor model. This factor accounts 40 \% of the variance. The scale has a good predictive value, and we can observe a significant correlation with the EPDS periods 1 and 2 (r = 0.56 ; p \textexclamdown{} 0.05). This result shows that the depressive mothers mood intensity predicts a future depressive risk. Furthermore, correlations between EPDS and BDI (r = 0.68 ; p \textexclamdown{} 0.05) and EPDS and HDRS (r = 0.67 ; p \textexclamdown{} 0.05) show a good convergent validity. The reliability study confirms the good internal consistency of the EPDS, at 3 days postpartum and in the postpartum depression symptomatology evaluation (Cronbach's Alpha \textquestiondown{} 0.80). In conclusion, this scale demonstrates good validity and is fast and easy use in obstetrical services, allowing early detection of women who risk to develop postpartum depression and, in the first week of postpartum, of mothers who suffer from a major postpartum depression. The use of the EPDS for an early screening of the risk of postnatal depression which is essential considering the consequences that postnatal depression can have on the development of the infant, on the quality of the relationship within the couple and on other social relationships. Mothers at risk for postnatal depression should be controlled and surveyed by the health professionals in obstetrical clinics.},

  abstract = {Objective Prenatal exposure to stress and fever are factors lowering seizure threshold in animal models. The fever effect on seizure threshold is well documented in human infants, however the associations between maternal perinatal stress and infants' susceptibility to seizures is unknown. This is the first study in humans to investigate longitudinally, whether in humans, the effect of maternal perinatal emotional symptoms such as stress, anxiety and depression that may trigger a biological stress response on age at first seizure occurrence. Method The study sample is a subgroup drawn from a longitudinal follow up cohort (3D cohort study: Design, Develop, Discover, N=2366 mother-infant dyads). Twenty-nine otherwise healthy infants who had a febrile seizure (FS) episode before the last follow-up visit (around 24 months of age) were studied. Mothers completed questionnaires regarding their emotional health at each pregnancy trimester and at three months postpartum. The link between maternal emotional symptoms and infant age at first FS was assessed through correlations and multiple regressions. Results We found that maternal anxiety symptoms during the second trimester of pregnancy are linked to the age at first FS (r(23)=-0.459, p=0.021) and explain 21.1\% of its variance. Postnatal maternal depression symptoms at 3 months postpartum were also associated with the age at first FS (r(23)=-0.587, p=0.002) and explained an additional 17.6\% of variance. Together, the variables explained 38.7\% of the variance in age at first FS. Maternal perceived stress symptoms at 3 months postpartum were also linked to the age at first FS (r(23)=-0.418, p=0.038), however, stress did not significantly contribute to the variance of age at first FS.. Significance Our results suggest a link between increased perinatal maternal emotional symptoms and the age at first FS. An earlier age at first FS may be the manifestation of a lower seizure threshold. Early first seizure occurrence is a risk factor for compromised neurological and cognitive development. Further studies should address the mechanisms by which perinatal maternal emotional symptoms may have an impact on seizure threshold in humans.},

Method Two hundred high-risk pregnant inpatients at a national public maternity hospital were included. Three psychometric assessment tools were used to evaluate all participants: the diagnostic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the screening EPDS and STAI. Results Rates of major depression, minor depression, anxiety disorder (agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder), and comorbid depression and anxiety were 11\%, 7\%, 12.5\% and 5\%, respectively. Major depression was more prevalent in high-risk pregnancies than in the historical cohort of unspecified obstetric risk (11\% versus 4.3\%). EPDS (cutoff 8/9) screens well for depression and anxiety in high-risk pregnancies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.82\textendash 0.87).

  abstract = {Background Infertility, and fertility treatment, are associated with psychological distress that may influence subsequent mental health including postpartum depression and anxiety. Methods Data for women who had a livebirth between 1991 and 2013 were drawn from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Conception history prior to their first recorded birth was categorised as `no fertility problems', `untreated subfertility', ovulation induction (OI), and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Depression and/or anxiety in the 12 months postpartum were identified using records of diagnoses, symptoms, and prescriptions. Prevalence was compared, and odds ratios estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results Of 235,127 mothers, 31,947 (13.6\%) had evidence of postpartum depression and/or anxiety. Mothers in the ART group had 22\% lower odds of postnatal depression and/or anxiety compared to mothers in the fertile group (OR 0.78; 95\% CI [0.70\textendash 0.86]; p \textexclamdown{} 0.0001). Accounting for prior mental health, lifestyle, sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors reduced the strength of the association (aOR 0.87; 95\% CI [0.78\textendash 0.97]; p = 0.01). There were no significant associations observed in the untreated subfertility or OI groups. Limitations As in any analysis of routine data, the quality of recording is important and some information was unavailable (e.g. education, social support). Conclusions Women with a history of subfertility, OI or ART treatment were not at increased risk of postpartum depression and/or anxiety compared to those with no fertility problems. It is important to explore whether women who underwent ART are less likely to experience depression/anxiety or do not seek help when needed, with implications for their health and care.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen increased reports of disturbed sleep worldwide; however, the degree this extends to pregnancy or influences pregnancy mental health outcomes has not been examined. The goal of this study was to examine changes in pregnant individuals' sleep, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and to understand how sleep was associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression over time. Methods The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. About 3747 pregnant individuals participated between April and July 2020. The present analysis was restricted to participants who completed at least 2 assessments, yielding a final sample of 1842 pregnant individuals. Results Depression symptoms were elevated at baseline, compared to prepandemic estimates of prevalence, but declined gradually over time. Shorter sleep duration, higher sleep disturbance, and more sleep-related impairments at baseline predicted a slower decline in depression symptoms over time. More sleep disturbances at baseline also predicted slower decline in anxiety symptoms over time. In contrast, rates of depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline were not predictive of changes in any of the 3 sleep variables over time. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for sleep problems in pregnancy, in order to optimize mental health throughout pregnancy and mitigate long-term negative outcomes.},

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study for postpartum women in October 2020 in Japan (N = 600). The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure postpartum depression. The prevalence ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression models, adjusting for age, education, household income, residential area, parity, the timing of delivery, and a prior history of depression. Results The prevalence of postpartum depression was 28.7\% (EPDS {$\geq$}9, which is frequently used in Japan), 18.6\% ({$\geq$}11), and 13.1\% ({$\geq$}13). Social restrictions, including cancellation of home visits by healthcare professionals and cancellation of infant checkups or vaccinations, loss of support during pregnancy or after delivery, including loss of opportunities to consult with healthcare professionals or friends and cancellation of parents or other family members' visits to support, and loss of autonomy about delivery or breastfeeding, were associated with postnatal depression. Conclusions At least 13\% of women who delivered and raised babies during the COVID-19 pandemic had postpartum depressive symptoms. COVID-19 related social restrictions and loss of social support from healthcare professionals, families, and friends were significantly associated with postpartum depression. In addition, loss of maternal autonomy in delivery and breastfeeding was associated with postpartum depression.

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PPD by screening mothers with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), to assess the behavioural outcome of children born to mothers with and without epilepsy and to investigate the relationship between PPD and children's behavioural problems. Method We enrolled 80 pregnancies of women with epilepsy, who filled in EPDS after birth, and afterward we asked them to complete the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results 23.8\% of patients presented PPD. Children, when the CBCL were completed, had a mean age of 6.05 {$\pm$} 3.07 years. The CBCL results indicate the occurrence of at least one behavioural issue in 25.0\% (20/80) of children. CBCL scores revealed a higher prevalence of behavioural disturbances with regards to the CBCL Total (P = 0.016), internalizing (P = 0.014) and somatic problems (P = 0.048) in patients with PPD vs. patients without PPD. We found an association between mothers' EPDS total score and children's CBCL global score (P = 0.034), internalizing score (P = 0.021), anxiety problems (P = 0.05), affective problems (P = 0.027) and withdrawn/depressed (P = 0.05). We recorded a statistically higher malformation rate in patients with PPD (P = 0.005) compared to the general population. Conclusions Children born from mothers with epilepsy have an increased risk for emotional disorders. These findings highlight the importance of screening for emotional distress and providing adequate interventions to children born to women with epilepsy.},

Although there are some studies based on psychiatric symptom scales, the relationship between HG and psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and personality disorders, is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there is a difference among women with and without HG with respect to frequency of mood, anxiety and personality disorders. Methods The study sample was composed of 52 patients with HG and 90 control pregnant women. Mood and anxiety disorders were ascertained by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Personality disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Revised Third Edition, Personality Disorders (SCID-II). Results The prevalence of any mood disorder and any anxiety disorder in women with HG was 15.4\% and 36.5\%, respectively. In addition, 19 (36.5\%) of the patients with HG had at least one personality disorder. According to reports collected from the participants in the study, most of the mood or anxiety disorders occurred before the pregnancy in women with HG. The prevalence of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and obsessive\textendash compulsive personality disorder was significantly higher in women with HG compared to the control subjects. Conclusions The results of the present study suggest that mood and anxiety disorders, and personality disturbances are frequently observed among women with HG and that there is a potential relationship between these psychiatric disorders and HG during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental well-being. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. Methods Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26\textendash 28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26\textendash 28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score \textquestiondown{} 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS {$\geq$} 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state {$\geq$} 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates. Results Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0\textmu mol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95\% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10\textmu mol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95\% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being. Conclusions We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12\% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy.},

L'approche GABAergique constitue une cible th\'erapeutique prometteuse. Introduction Prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) ranges from 10 to 15 \% of parturients. The impact of the PPD is major on the maternal bond and the health of both mother and child. Its physiopathological mechanisms appear to differ from other types of depression. Today, pharmacotherapy is based on nonspecific treatment, and recent therapeutic advances in this field require a comprehensive approach of the implication of the GABAergic system in the development of PPD. Neurosteroid levels during pregnancy and after parturition and the GABA-A-r modulation are thought to be involved in PPD. Objective To evaluate if the GABAergic approach is relevant in postpartum depression management. Methods We conducted a systematic review of literature based on the MEDLINE database with the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): ``postpartum depression'', ``GABA'', ``ganaxolone'', ``brexanolone'', ``allopregnanolone'', prior to September 2019. We selected articles in English: preclinical and clinical studies, literature review, observational and therapeutic studies. Results Preclinical models (mouse and rat) show changes in GABAergic inhibition in the peripartum period and correlation between allopregnanolone and GABA-A-r plasticity. This plasticity in the peripartum period maintains levels of inhibition adapted despite increased neurosteroid levels. KO models for the GABA-A-r {$\delta$} subunit develop depression and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum period, and a change in the expression of the gene coding for the GABA-R alpha-4 subunit was found. Artificial inhibition of progesterone metabolism during post-partum increased depression symptoms. GABAergic fluctuation seems to be interrelated with other systems such as those of oxytocins. A synthetic neurosteroid (SGE-516) was tested on mouse models of PPD, KO for {$\delta$}-GABA-A-r or KCC2, and showed decreased depressive symptoms and better mothering. Clinical studies confirm neurosteroid fluctuation and changes in the GABAergic system during the peripartum period. Allopregnanolone is the neurosteroid the most studied in PPD, and it is elevated in the brain during the pregnancy. Studies disagree on the presence of significant differences in allopregnanolone plasma levels during pregnancy or postpartum between women with PPD or not. Women with a history of PPD have greater susceptibility to neurosteroid withdrawal. Imagery and genetical data also show a link between allopregnanolone and PPD. The GABA-A-r may not recover in time following a reduced number during pregnancy, and this mismatch between neurosteroid levels and their receptor may trigger PPD. Several randomized controlled trials investigated brexanolone administrated IV, a synthetic formulation of allopregnanolone, and demonstrated a rapid and well tolerated reduction in depressive symptoms. In March 2019 brexanolone obtained FDA approval in PPD indication under the name Zulresso. However, there are differences in the time of beginning of PPD, which could constitute different subgroups of this disease, and which physiopathology could respond to different mechanisms. Prenatal depression does not respond to a GABAergic approach, but women without any risk factor or previous mood disorder developing PPD in the weeks following childbirth could be particularly responsive to this kind of treatment. Conclusion Disability to modulate GABA-A-r expression during pregnancy and restore its previous state after parturition appears to trigger PPD. The GABAergic system is a promising pharmacotherapy target. From preclinical to clinical studies for about twenty years the GABAergic system has been incriminated and targeted in this challenging mental disease.},

Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) during critical periods of development (pregnancy and lactation) is essential for cortical maturation, synaptogenesis and myelination, and may also mitigate the risk for cognitive deficits and psychopathologies in young adults. The present study was performed to evaluate the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) receptors, particularly of 5-HT1A, and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the antidepressant effect of {$\omega$}-3 PUFA supplementation. In Experiment 1, the antidepressant effects of fish oil were assessed by the modified forced swim test in adult rats. The data indicated a robust antidepressant effect produced by this supplementation and that treatment of the rats with WAY 100135 reversed this effect. In Experiment 2, cortical and hippocampal contents of BDNF, 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), were determined in animals subjected to the same protocol. Increased BDNF expression in the cortex and hippocampus of both age groups was detected. In 90 day-old rats, 5-HT content in the hippocampus was increased, whereas 5-HIAA formation was diminished in the fish oil group. We suggest the occurrence of a reciprocal involvement of 5-HT1A receptors activation and the hippocampal BDNF-increased expression mediated by fish oil supplementation. These data corroborate and expand the notion that supplementation with {$\omega$}-3 PUFA produces antidepressant effects mediated by an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus.

This study aimed to examine the prevalence of insomnia and its risk factors in Chinese women during pregnancy. Methods In this cross sectional study, 436 Chinese pregnant women with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) {$\geq$} 8 were clinically assessed using the insomnia criteria based on the combination of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th Edition) and ICD-10 (International Classification of Dieases, 10th Edition). Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), Pregnancy Pressure Scale (PPS), Perceived physical discomfort level and number, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and a general socio-demographic questionnaire were administered. Results The results showed that about 20\% of the pregnant women met the strict diagnosis criteria of insomnia. Independent-samples t-test revealed that several risk factors were correlated with the group with insomnia (N = 84) compared to the group without insomnia (N = 352). Binary Logistic regression analysis found that more significant bed partner influence (OR = 1.92, 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 3.60), depressive symptoms (OR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.00\textendash 1.14), daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.01\textendash 1.14), subjective somatic discomfort (OR = 2.27, 95\% CI: 1.11\textendash 4.65), kinds of somatic discomfort (OR = 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 1.27) and later gestation (OR = 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.01\textendash 1.09) were significantly associated with insomnia. Conclusion In this cohort of Chinese pregnant women, about a fifth of women suffered from clinically significant insomnia. Measures to prevent the adverse effects of insomnia should be provided to pregnant women with depressive symptoms, Sleep disturbance of the bed partner, excessive daytime sleepiness and somatic discomfort, especially late in gestation.},

Method This retrospective cohort study linked hospital discharge records for 8,951,763 California singleton births occurring 1/1/91-12/31/08 from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development with diagnostic and service records from the Department of Developmental Services. Medical records documenting maternal mood and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia ICD-9-CM codes were identified, and 42,423 children were categorized with a DSM-IV diagnosis of `autistic disorder'. Log-linear Poisson models explored the relationships between maternal psychiatric disorders and autism, adjusting for maternal education, race, country of birth, and parental age. Results Rates of maternal psychiatric diagnoses were lower than expected for the population, reflecting under-recognition and under-reporting by inpatient clinicians. In adjusted analyses, mothers diagnosed with one individual psychiatric condition were 1.2\textendash 2.8 times more likely to have a child who developed autism. Mothers diagnosed with any one or more psychiatric condition were twice as likely to have a child with autism compared with unaffected or unreported women (RR=1.97; 95\% CI 1.83\textendash 2.12). Conclusions Women with a documented inpatient medical record history of psychiatric diagnosis were nearly twice as likely as women without such diagnoses to have a child later diagnosed with autism. These findings highlight the need for routine prenatal screening for psychiatric conditions, as well as enhanced neurobehavioral assessment of children born to these mothers to detect early autism signs and optimize intervention timeliness.},

We aimed to examine associations between psychotropic medication use and intimate partner violence (IPV) in an Australian population-based sample. Methods Prospective cohort study of 1507 first-time mothers recruited in early pregnancy (mean gestation 15 weeks) from public maternity hospitals in Melbourne Australia. Follow-up questionnaires at 12 months and four years included validated measures of intimate partner violence (Composite Abuse Scale), and maternal mental health (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, SF-36). Data on use of psychotropic medications was collected using a self-report measure at four years postpartum. Results At four years postpartum, almost one in eight mothers (13.9\%) were taking psychotropic medication. The prevalence of psychotropic medication use in women experiencing concurrent IPV was considerably higher compared to women not experiencing IPV (25\% vs 11\%, Odds Ratio = 2.68, 95\% CI 1.73\textendash 4.15). Women experiencing IPV were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medication, even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms (Adj OR = 1.86, 95\% CI 1.16 to 2.96). Only 5\% of women reporting IPV at four years postpartum had discussed this with a general practitioner. Limitations Limitations include use of a self-report measure to assess psychotropic medication use, lack of data on the use of psychological counselling and/or other specialist mental health services and potential for attrition to bias results (addressed using multiple imputation). Conclusions Our findings reinforce the need for health professionals treating women for depressive symptoms to inquire about IPV and tailor responses accordingly.},

  abstract = {Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0\% vs 29.6\%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.},

Methods A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. Results A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8\% and 6.9\%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression. Conclusions Our study revealed factors associated with psychological symptoms among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19-pandemic era.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with all the women who delivered in a hospital and were screened for depression during routine postpartum home visits in Shenzhen between 2015 August and 2017 April. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used as the screening tool with a cut-off score of 10. Predictors of PPD were determined by Chi-square test and stepwise logistic regression. Results Approximately 300,000 puerperal women were included in the study with a PPD prevalence of 4.3\%. Prenatal anxiety and depression were associated with 4.55 and 3.80 times of PPD risk, respectively. Stressful life events, family history of mental illness, poor economic status, low Apgar scores and birth defects of the infants, bottle and mixed feeding, as well as living with parents-in-low after childbirth were related to moderate risk. Higher gravidity and parity, larger gestation age, prenatal education, and living with the women's own parents were associated with lower risk. Limitations The large sample size might have suggested statistically significant differences which were not practical. Conclusions The prevalence of PPD at community level is significantly lower than the rates detected within hospitals. Prenatal anxiety and depression are the most important predictors of PPD.

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of postpartum depression at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Pristina, Kosovo (a tertiary referral center). Material and methods A prospective observational cohort study was conducted from June 2019 to October 2019 at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Pristina, Kosovo. A total of 247 delivery women were screened for postpartum depression at 6 weeks following delivery using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Socio-demographic, obstetric and psychologic factors were tested as predictors of PPD using bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis (Logit model). Odds ratio (OR) with 95 \% confidence intervals were calculated for each risk factor. The p values \textexclamdown{} 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The prevalence of PPD at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Kosovo teaching hospital was 21 \% at 6 weeks following childbirth. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four predictor variables for postpartum depression: pregnancy complications (OR 1.057; 95 \% CI; 1.002\textendash 1.114 and P = 0.040); fear of childbirth (OR 1.121; 95 \% CI; 1.057\textendash 1.190 and P = 0.00016); prenatal depression or anxiety (OR 1.088; 95 \% CI; 1.032\textendash 1.147 and P = 0.0018); poor marital relation (OR 1.085, 95 \% CI; 1.002\textendash 1.174 and P = 0.044). No statistically significant association was found between the postpartum depression (PPD) and maternal age, education, employment, family type, smoking, previous abortion, parity, household income, social support, child gender, birthweight, and breast feeding. Conclusions The high prevalence of postpartum depression in our setting and its known adverse effects on woman, infant and her family implies an urgent need for evidence-based interventions. Such interventions are needed to promote knowledge of perinatal mental illness and improve maternal mental health in particular in less developed countries. Future efforts should address early identification of high-risk women, assessment of risk factor during the antenatal period, early postpartum depression screening and timely therapeutic approaches, to improve social and psychological functioning of the woman.},

  abstract = {Background Antenatal depression has been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and threatened miscarriage is often seen clinically to impact adversely on maternal wellbeing, notwithstanding the limited research evidence. Our study aims to examine the link between threatened miscarriage and antenatal depression and anxiety in an Asian obstetric population. Methods We recruited 121 women and 68 partners facing threatened miscarriage, and 241 women and 180 partners experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies from a tertiary maternity hospital in Singapore. All participants completed a Patient Information Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results The proportion of women with major depressive and anxiety symptomatology was significantly higher among women facing threatened miscarriage compared to those with stable pregnancies (depressive: 33.1\% vs. 17.0\%, p = 0.008; anxiety: 48.8\% vs. 23.7\%, p \textexclamdown{} 0.0001). Amongst their partners, there was a non-significant trend towards a similar finding (depressive: 10.3\% vs. 7.2\%, p = 0.439; anxiety: 23.5\% vs. 18.9\%, p = 0.478). Threatened miscarriage remained significantly associated with major depressive symptomatology after adjusting for potential confounders among women (OR 2.70; 95\% CI 1.55, 4.71; p \textexclamdown{} 0.0001) but not among their partners (OR 1.47; 95\% CI 0.56, 3.87; p = 0.430). Limitations This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size for male partners. Conclusion Antenatal depressive and anxiety symptomatology affects one in four women in their first trimester, with even higher prevalence among women facing threatened miscarriage. Targeted depression and anxiety screening that includes women facing threatened miscarriages may facilitate early and efficient detection and management of mental health problems among pregnant women.},

  abstract = {Study and Objectives Controversy exists over psychological risks associated with unwanted pregnancy and consecutive abortion. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological health of female adolescents following artificial abortion up to 12th week of pregnancy. Design The control case study. Setting The study was carried out in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Clinical Center Tuzla, in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Participants We assessed 120 female adolescents. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 17.7 (1.5) years experiencing sexual intercourse in the age of 14\textendash 19 years for trauma experiences, presence of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety as state, and anxiety as trait. Sixty adolescents had intentional artificial abortion and 60 had sexual intercourse but did not become pregnant. Main Outcome Measures We used the PTSD Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y) for assessment of anxiety in adolescents. Basic socio-demographic data were also collected. Results PTSD presented significantly more often in adolescents who aborted pregnancy (30\%), than in adolescents who did not abort (13.3\%) (odds ratio = 4.91 (95\%CI 0.142-0.907) P = 0.03). Anxiety as state and as trait were significantly higher in the abortion group, as the mean (SD) anxiety score of patients was 59.8 (8.9), 57.9 (9.7) respectively, than in non-abortion group 49.5 (8.8), 47.3 (9.9) respectively (t = 6.392, P \textexclamdown{} 0.001; t = 5.914, P \textexclamdown{} 0.001, respectively). Adolescents who aborted pregnancy had significantly higher depression symptoms severity 29.2 (5.6) than controls 15.2 (3.3) (t = 8.322, P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), and they presented significantly more often depression (75\%), than adolescents who did not abort (10\%) ({$\chi$}2 = 53.279, P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Logistic regression showed that only experience of life threatening(s) and injury of other person(s) reliably predicted PTSD, whereas abortion and experience of life threatening(s) reliably predicted depression. Conclusion Adolescents who aborted pregnancy presented significantly greater prevalence of PTSD and depression, and significantly greater depression severity and anxiety as state and trait than those who did not abort. Abortion predicted depression only, and did not predict PTSD.},
