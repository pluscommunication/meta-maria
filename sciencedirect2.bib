abstract = {Background
Australian clinical practice guidelines support comprehensive psychosocial assessment as a routine component of maternity care.
Aim
To examine the concurrent and predictive validity of the Antenatal Risk Questionnaire-Revised (ANRQ-R) when used across the perinatal period.
Methods
Women completed the ANRQ-R and a diagnostic reference standard (SAGE-SR) in the second and third trimesters and at 3-months postpartum. ANRQ-R test performance for cut-off scores at each time-point was assessed using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Findings
Overall sample sizes were N=1166 (second trimester), N=957 (third trimester) and N=796 (3-month postpartum). 6.5%, 5.6% and 6.2% of women met SAGE-SR criteria for any depressive or anxiety disorder at these time-points (‘cases’), respectively. ROC analysis yielded acceptable areas under the curve (AUC) when the ANRQ-R was used to detect current (AUC=0.789−0.798) or predict future (AUC=0.705−0.789) depression or anxiety. Using an example cut-off score of 18 or more, the ANRQ-R correctly classified 72–76% of concurrent ‘cases’ and ‘non-cases’ (sensitivity=0.70−0.74, specificity=0.72−0.76) and correctly predicted 74–78% of postnatal ‘cases’ and ‘non-cases’ (sensitivity=0.52−0.72, specificity=0.75−0.79). Completion of the ANRQ-R earlier in pregnancy yielded greater positive likelihood ratios for predicting depression or anxiety at 3-months postpartum (cut-off ≥18: second trimester=3.8; third trimester=2.2).
Conclusion
The ANRQ-R is a structured psychosocial assessment questionnaire that can be scored to provide an overall measure of psychosocial risk. Cut-off scores need not be uniform across settings. Such decisions should be guided by factors including diagnostic prevalence rates, local needs and resource availability.}

Objectifs
Estimer l’incidence du trouble stress post-traumatique du post-partum (TSPT-PP) chez les primipares, déterminer les facteurs qui lui sont associés et dresser le profil des femmes à risque de développer ce trouble.
Méthodes
Il s’agissait d’une étude descriptive, prospective et longitudinale. Au premier temps de l’étude, nous avons évalué la douleur de l’accouchement, la dissociation et la détresse péri-traumatique. Au deuxième temps de l’étude, nous avons dépisté le TSPT-PP.
Résultats
La population de l’étude comportait 183 parturientes au premier temps de l’étude et 150 parturientes au deuxième temps de l’étude. L’incidence du TSPT-PP était de 9,3 %. En étude multivariée, certains facteurs étudiés étaient significativement associés au développement du TSPT-PP à savoir les antécédents d’interruption thérapeutique de grossesse, les antécédents de fausse couche, l’exposition à un événement stressant durant la grossesse, l’hospitalisation prénatale de la mère, l’accouchement instrumental, l’intensité de la douleur en particulier dans sa composante affective, la dissociation péri-traumatique et l’évitement des rapports sexuels par peur d’une nouvelle grossesse. En revanche, le contact physique précoce avec le nouveau-né immédiatement après l’accouchement était un facteur protecteur significatif.
Conclusion
Les conséquences psychologiques associées au premier accouchement, particulièrement le TSPT-PP sont fréquentes. Un repérage des femmes à risque et un dépistage systématique des symptômes de stress post-traumatique du post-partum sont souhaitables.
Objectives
The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of the post-partum post-traumatic stress disorder (PP-PTSD) in primiparous women, and to determine the profile of women at risk of developing this disorder.
Methods
We conducted a descriptive, prospective and longitudinal study carried out at the maternity department of the Hedi Chaker Hospital, Sfax-Tunisia over a period of 15 months. At the first stage of the study, the Saint-Antoine pain questionnaire, the peri-traumatic dissociative experiences questionnaire and the peri-traumatic distress inventory were used respectively to assess the pain of delivery, the peri-traumatic dissociation and distress. At the second stage of the study, the questionnaires, perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder (PPQ), hospital anxiety and depression scale and the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale were used respectively for the PP-PTSD screening and the assessment of the post-partum anxious and depressive symptomatology.
Results
The study population consisted of 183 parturients at the first stage of the study and 150 parturients at the second stage of the study. The incidence of the PP-PTSD was 9.3 %. In the multivariate study, some factors studied were significantly associated with the development of PTSD-PP, including a history of therapeutic termination of pregnancy, a history of miscarriage, exposure to a stressful event during pregnancy, prenatal hospitalization of the mother, instrumental delivery, pain intensity especially in the affective component, peri-traumatic dissociation and avoidance of sexual intercourse for fear of a new pregnancy. However the skin to skin contact with the new-born immediately after delivery was a significant protective factor.
Conclusion
The psychological consequences associated with the first birth, particularly the PP-PTSD, are common. The Identification of women at risk and a systematic screening of postpartum post-traumatic stress symptoms are desirable.}

Material y métodos
Cuatrocientos treinta pacientes con embarazo y partos sin complicaciones que se aleatorizan en dos grupos homogéneos (grupo con VPT y grupo control). Se utilizó la hospital anxiety and depresión scale para valorar la depresión posparto a los 7 y 30 días.
Resultados
Se observó un score positivo para depresión puerperal a los 7 días del parto en un 10,2%. En el grupo de VPT se observó una disminución de incidencia de la depresión puerperal (0,9%) frente al grupo control (3,7%).
Conclusión
La incidencia de depresión posparto en nuestra área es similar a la esperada. La visita puerperal temprana parece ser útil en la detección de patología psiquiátrica y disminuye la evolución de los síntomas.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to determine the influence of early postpartum home visits in reducing the incidence of puerperal depression in our environment.
Material and methods
A total of 430 patients with uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery were randomized to two homogeneous groups (one group receiving an early postpartum home visit and a control group). The hospital anxiety and depression scale was used to assess puerperal depression at 7 and 30 days.
Results
At 7 days, 10.2% of the patients had a positive score for puerperal depression. At 30 days, the incidence of puerperal depression was lower in the group receiving an early home visit (0.9%) than in the control group (3.7%).
Conclusion
The incidence of postpartum depression in our setting was similar to the expected incidence. Early postpartum home visits seem to be useful in detecting this disorder and in reducing symptoms.}

abstract = {Purpose
To identify the prevalence of risk behaviors and related risk factors in adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand.
Methods
Youth risk behavior survey questionnaires were collected from 2311 adolescents in 8 schools, 13 communities and 2 Juvenile Home Institutions from January to February 2001. Their mean age was 15.5 ± 1.8 years, and 59% were female. Risk factors of interest were gender, parental marital status, socioeconomic status, family relationship, parental drug addiction, peer group, loneliness, self-esteem, and school performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors associated with each risk behavior.
Results
The risk behaviors leading to traffic accidents were rarely or never having worn a seat belt (30.6%) or helmet while bicycling (66.9%) and while motorcycling (50.1%), riding with drivers who had consumed alcohol (18.8%), and driving after consuming alcohol (12.1%). The studied group carried weapons (8.5%) and has been involved in a violent event (31.5%). Among 13.9% who were assaulted, 6.7% needed hospitalization; rape was reported by 2.4%. Depression was reported by 19.9%, with 12% having suicidal tendencies and 8% attempting suicide. The lifetime use vs. heavy use prevalence of substance abuse, respectively, was: 15.4% and 3.5% for smoking, 37.3% and 1.7% for alcohol, 37.8% and 4.6% for amphetamine use, and 37.9% and 0.1% for other drugs. Among the 10% who have had sexual intercourse, 1% were homosexual, 7.1% have never used a condom, and 2.1% resulted in pregnancy. Being male was a risk factor for every untoward behavior except depression. Other risk factors included poor self-esteem, poor school performance, and early school leaving. Factors relating to the family included a low socioeconomic status, poor relationships, broken families, and parental substance abuse. Socioenvironmental factors included being in a gang and loneliness. Some risk behaviors started at younger than 8 years old. Schools and media were given as the sources of information regarding sex, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and substance abuse.
Conclusions
The prevalence of six major-risk behaviors in adolescents in Bangkok was significantly high. Several risk factors were identified, the knowledge from which may help to form preventive measures in this population.}

To investigate the prevalence and correlates of psychopathology, as measured by the Youth Self-Report Scale, in pregnant adolescents so that interventions during pregnancy may be tailored to treat the psychopathology and thereby improve maternal and child outcomes.
Methods:
Scores on seven psychologic syndromes (withdrawn, delinquent, aggressive behaviors; anxiety/ depression; and social, thought, and attention problems) were compared for groups of pregnant adolescents (n = 185), never pregnant teenagers (n = 126), and previously published normative samples of clinically referred (n = 518) and nonreferred (n = 518) female adolescents using chi-square, Student's t-tests, analysis of covariance, or multiple logistic regression. Correlates of psychopathology were identified for the pregnant sample using odds ratios and 95% confidence limits.
Results:
Pregnant adolescents exhibited less serious or lower rates of psychopathology than groups against which they were compared. Correlates of psychopathology included substance use during pregnancy, prior assault, maternal childbirth before age 18 years, ethnicity, ≥ 3 sexual partners, and absence of a relationship with the baby's father.
Conclusions:
Although the prevalence of psychopathology was lower among pregnant patients, those who exhibit psychopathology are likely to engage in risky health behaviors that contribute to poor perinatal outcome.}

abstract = {Objective
to examine the effects of supervised group exercise on maternal psychological outcomes and commonly reported pregnancy complaints.
Design
an observer-blinded randomized controlled trial.
Setting
Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway.
Participants
105 sedentary, nulliparous pregnant women, mean age 30.7(±4.0) years, pre-pregnancy BMI 23.8 (±4.3), were assigned to either exercise (n=52) or control group (n= 53) at mean gestation week 17.7 (±4.2).
Intervention
the exercise intervention followed ACOG guidelines and included a 60 minutes general fitness class, with 40 minutes of endurance training/aerobic and 20 minutes of strength training and stretching/relaxation, performed at least twice per week for a minimum of 12 weeks.
Measurements
outcome measures were assessed through standardized interviews pre- and post-intervention (gestation week 36.6, ±0.9), and included psychological variables related to quality of life, well-being, body image and pregnancy depression, as well as assessment of 13 commonly reported pregnancy complaints.
Findings
post-intervention, using intention to treat (ITT) analysis, women randomized to exercise rated their health significantly better compared to women in the control group (p=0.02) and reported less fatigue related to everyday activities (p=0.04). Women with complete exercise adherence (≥24 sessions) had significantly better scores on measurements of feelings related to sadness, hopelessness and anxiety (p<0.01), compared to the control group. Contradictory, the control group reported higher life enjoyment (p<0.01). There were no significant group differences in body-image or pregnancy depression. With respect to analysing pregnancy complaints according to ITT, no differences between the groups were found. A comparison of the women who attended ≥19 (80%, n=21) or ≥24 (100%, n=14) exercise sessions with the control-participants, showed that fewer women in the exercise group reported nausea/vomiting and numbness/poor circulation in legs.
Key conclusion and implication for practise
participation in regular group exercise during pregnancy contributed to improvements in some variables related to maternal well-being and quality of life. Women with high exercise adherence had significantly better results on several health variables reaping the highest benefits. A qualitative study exploring the barriers of women in achieving recommended amount of activity may be necessary to understand this population and developing better clinical practice educational tools.}

This study aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and factors associated with PTS-C and PTS-O in postpartum women. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional population-based survey of 16,000 postpartum women, selected at random from birth registrations in England to receive a postal questionnaire, including the Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 4,509 women. The median age was 32 years (IQR=29-36), 64% were married, 77% were UK-born, and 76% were White-British. Prevalence of PTS-C was 2.5% (95%CI:2.0-3.0) and prevalence of PTS-O was 6.8% (95%CI:6.0-7.8). Women with PTS-C were significantly more likely to report re-experiencing symptoms (Chi-Square=7.69,p<0.01). Factors associated with PTS-C were: higher level of deprivation, not having a health professional to talk to about sensitive issues during pregnancy, and the baby being admitted for neonatal intensive care. Factors associated with PTS-O were: age ≤24 years, depression during pregnancy, and having a pregnancy affected by long-term health problems. Factors associated with both were: living without a partner, anxiety during pregnancy, pregnancy-specific health problems, and lower birth satisfaction. Conclusions: PTS during the postpartum period is relatively common and, for many women, unrelated to childbirth. Increased awareness among health professionals of prevalence, clinical characteristics and factors associated with postpartum PTS-C and PTS-O will aid the development of appropriate management protocols to identify and support women during the perinatal period.

To determine the extent to which medical record history of maternal psychiatric diagnoses was associated with offspring autism risk in a large, socio-demographically diverse birth cohort.
Method
This retrospective cohort study linked hospital discharge records for 8,951,763 California singleton births occurring 1/1/91-12/31/08 from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development with diagnostic and service records from the Department of Developmental Services. Medical records documenting maternal mood and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia ICD-9-CM codes were identified, and 42,423 children were categorized with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ‘autistic disorder’. Log-linear Poisson models explored the relationships between maternal psychiatric disorders and autism, adjusting for maternal education, race, country of birth, and parental age.
Results
Rates of maternal psychiatric diagnoses were lower than expected for the population, reflecting under-recognition and under-reporting by inpatient clinicians. In adjusted analyses, mothers diagnosed with one individual psychiatric condition were 1.2–2.8 times more likely to have a child who developed autism. Mothers diagnosed with any one or more psychiatric condition were twice as likely to have a child with autism compared with unaffected or unreported women (RR=1.97; 95% CI 1.83–2.12).
Conclusions
Women with a documented inpatient medical record history of psychiatric diagnosis were nearly twice as likely as women without such diagnoses to have a child later diagnosed with autism. These findings highlight the need for routine prenatal screening for psychiatric conditions, as well as enhanced neurobehavioral assessment of children born to these mothers to detect early autism signs and optimize intervention timeliness.}

La schizophrénie à début précoce, durant l’enfance, est un trouble rare : sa prévalence est environ 50 fois inférieure à celle des schizophrénies débutant à l’âge adulte. C’est un trouble aussi fréquemment méconnu, en raison notamment de la variation de son tableau clinique en fonction de l’âge. Les auteurs rapportent ici l’observation d’une petite fille qui, à l’âge de 9 ans, a développé un tableau clinique typique de schizophrénie, à début brutal. À partir de cette observation, plusieurs points sont discutés au vu des données de la littérature : l’importance des altérations retrouvées dans l’histoire prémorbide des enfants schizophrènes, l’importance des facteurs de vulnérabilité génétiques et des facteurs de stress précoces dans le déterminisme des troubles observés, les difficultés liées au traitement de ces formes à début précoce, enfin leur devenir, souvent péjoratif, notamment en termes d’adaptation psychosociale. Au total, et conformément aux données actuellement disponibles, cette observation suggère l’existence probable d’une continuité diagnostique entre l’enfance et l’âge adulte, les schizophrénies à début précoce apparaissant à la fois plus sévères et marquées par une plus grande vulnérabilité familiale que les schizophrénies débutant à la fin de l’adolescence ou à l’âge adulte.
Summary
Childhood-onset schizophrenia is rare : its prevalence is about 50 times lower than the one observed in adulthood. It is also frequently unrecognized, notably because its clinical aspect varies with age. The authors report the case of a prepubertal girl who developed a typical clinical picture of schizophrenia (paranoid subtype) by age 9.
Case report
The patient was 10 years old when she was hospitalized for a relapse of a suspected childhood-onset schizophrenia. Several significant mental disorders were found in her family history : her mother was treated for mood disorders (including dysthymia and major depression with postpartum onset), while her father and a aunt exhibited schizophrenic disorders. In addition, prenatal and perinatal events (including probable prenatal maternal infection and obstetric complications) were reported by her mother. Demonstrable impairments were already present in her premorbid development : from the age of 3.5, she showed significant manifestations of behavioural inhibition and separation anxiety, severe difficulties in social adaptation, and language abnormalities (qualified by her general practitioner as selective mutism). At the age of 9, when her mother was hospitalized for a diabetes mellitus, she suddenly showed auditory and visual hallucinations associated with delusions. Their content included filiation, somatic, and persecutory themes. Grossly disorganized behaviour (and more particularly catatonic motor behaviours including catatonic rigidity and negativism and bizarre postures) was also observed. Negative symptoms (eg anhedonia, affective flattening, and alogia) were noted. Her IQ scores were 74 in the verbal subtests and 53 in the performance subtests. Because the diagnostic of childhood-onset schizophrenia was suspected, a neuroleptic treatment, haloperidol 3 mg/day, was tried. After a partial remission during a few months period (characterized by a decrease in delusions, anxiety and sleep difficulties), she showed a relapse leading to her hospitalization. At the time of her admission, she showed severe manifestations of separation anxiety including agitation, anger, crying, and insomnia, for which she received a short-lived treatment by lorazepam. When sedation was obtained, the clinical picture proved similar to the one previously observed : hallucinations, delusions, grossly disorganized behaviour, and thought disorder were noted. As soon as the diagnostic of childhood-onset schizophrenia was confirmed, she was administered a new antipsychotic agent, amisulpride, at dose of 600 mg/day. This treatment was going on during several weeks with no significant clinical effect. Because the early onset of the disorder, the family history of schizophrenia, and the lack of effectiveness of the two previously administered antipsychotic agents, a treatment with clozapine was started at the dose of 12,5 mg/day. From the outset of this treatment, clinically significant reductions in hallucinations and disorganized behaviours were noted. Dose was then progressively increased until 200 mg/day, resulting in significant improvement in cognitive and motor functionning. The patient is now in an educational institute. Her adaptation is considered satisfactory, in spite of regular exacerbations of delusions in response to stressful life events. Treatment with clozapine is going on, without any significant undesirable clinical effects.
Discussion
If an abrupt onset is rarely observed in prepubertal children, all the authors report that patients with very early onset schizophrenia show to have demonstrable impairments in their premorbid language as well as in their motor and social development. In addition, several studies suggest that more pronounced early developmental abnormalities are usually associated with a poor outcome in schizophrenia. The clinical picture also agrees with recent studies showing that in children paranoid subtype is as frequent as seen in adult disorders. If genetic factors play a significant role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, the notion that such factors may be more salient in very early onset and more severe cases is now usually accepted. However, a number of environmental factors, including prenatal maternal infections and perinatal complications, may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, in addition to genetic factors. Because a significant relationship between stressful life events and exacerbations in positive symptoms was found in the case reported, the authors examine the role of such stress factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and in the course of illness. A brief review of studies that have examined the effects of antipsychotic agents in children with schizophrenia underscores the paucity of data available to guide clinicians in this area. However, these data suggest that children who receive conventional neuroleptics experience significant adverse effects, primarily sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, they suggest that new antipsychotic agents, such as clozapine, may be more effective than conventional neuroleptics, particularly in negative symptoms. Lastly, the authors emphasize the poor outcome usually reported in childhood-onset schizophrenia, highlighting the need of a long-term pharmacological and behavioural treatment.
Conclusion
This case report, such as others, supports the hypothesis that there is a clinical continuity between early and later onset schizophrenia. It also suggests that very early onset schizophrenia is a more severe form of the disorder and may be secondary to greater familial vulnerability. Consequently, systematic studies of these patients may be particularly informative and may provide important informations for understanding the etiologic processes involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.}

abstract = {Objective
Perampanel is a once-daily oral anti-seizure medication for focal-onset seizures, with or without focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCS), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Study 402 (NCT02033902) collected safety information on clinically important treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from real-world clinical practice in patients aged ≥12 years with refractory epilepsy who were receiving perampanel as an add-on therapy.
Methods
Study 402 was a multicenter, observational, 52-week cohort study conducted in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Israel, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Safety data were gathered prospectively from patients at clinic visits. The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinically important TEAEs defined as dizziness; blurred vision; somnolence; aggression; balance disorders (including ataxia and falls); weight gain; suicidality; drug abuse, misuse, dependence, and withdrawal; skin photosensitivity; and unintended pregnancy while taking levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives. Off-label use of perampanel and outcomes associated with any suspected drug–drug interaction were also monitored and recorded. Secondary endpoints included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Clinical Global Impression of Change.
Results
Of 483 patients in the Safety Analysis Set, mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 38.3 (15.1) years, 48.4% were female, mean (SD) time since diagnosis was 23 (14.8) years, 56.5% had focal impaired awareness seizures, and 48.7% had FBTCS. Overall, 243 (49.3%) patients treated with perampanel completed the study and 227 (46.0%) patients discontinued. The most common primary reason for discontinuation was adverse events (n = 130 [26.4%]). A total of 301 (62.3%) patients reported at least one TEAE, of which 45 (15.0%) patients had severe TEAEs and 256 (85.0%) patients had TEAEs judged as mild to moderate in severity. Overall, 51 (10.6%) patients had serious TEAEs, including two deaths that were judged as not related to perampanel, and 136 (28.2%) patients experienced a TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation. Clinically important TEAEs were reported by 153 (31.7%) patients, with the most common being dizziness (13.9%), balance disorders (5.6%), aggression (5.4%), and weight gain (5.4%). In general, the frequencies of clinically important TEAEs were lower in this study compared with previous interventional clinical studies, except for the incidence of suicidality (2.1% vs 1.0%) and aggression (5.4% vs 5.1%). Mean total HADS scores were similar at the end of the study compared with baseline; at the end of treatment, most (>60%) patients had no shift in HADS score category; ∼15% of patients moved to a worse category vs baseline and ∼20% of patients moved to an improved category vs baseline for both anxiety and depression. Based on investigator assessment, disease severity was improved in 185/415 (44.6%) patients. A subanalysis in elderly patients aged ≥65 years showed similar results to the overall population.
Conclusions
The data from this observational study are consistent with the known safety profile of perampanel derived from previous interventional phase II and III clinical studies. No unusual or unexpected TEAEs were observed in this real-world clinical practice setting.}

abstract = {Objective
Australian women conceiving with ART are at fourfold risk of admission to early parenting treatment programs compared with those conceiving spontaneously. This study aimed to identify prevalence and determinants of antenatal mood disturbance and other risks for early parenting difficulties after assisted conception.
Design
A prospective longitudinal investigation from conception to 18 months postpartum using telephone interviews and self-report questionnaires.
Setting
Melbourne IVF and Royal Women's Hospital Reproductive Services, Victoria, Australia.
Patient(s)
A consecutive cohort of English-speaking women with ultrasound-confirmed ART-conceived pregnancies.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Standardized psychometric measures of mood, quality of marital relationship, mother-to-fetus emotional attachment, and personality.
Intervention(s)
None.
Result(s)
Of the 288 women with confirmed pregnancies, 239 were contactable, and 183 (77%) were recruited, 95% of whom completed both early and late pregnancy assessments. Participants were socioeconomically advantaged, had very good pregnancy health, exceptional marital relationships, normal personality styles, and intense affectionate attachment to the fetus. Very few (<5%) had clinically significant mood disturbance in late pregnancy.
Conclusion(s)
There were low rates of antenatal mood disturbance and other risk factors for postpartum depression. Pregnancy and motherhood might be idealized after ART conception, and preparation for the realities of infant care might then be insufficient.}

The Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies and the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness were used to generate diagnoses according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. After delivery, women completed eight items of the Difficult Infant Temperament Questionnaire (developed by our team) and filled in, again, the BDI-II and were interviewed with the DIGS. Women with depression (DSM-IV/ICD-10) and probable cases of depression using different cut-offs adjusted to Portuguese prevalence (BDI-II), in pregnancy and postpartum, were excluded. The Difficult Infant Temperament Questionnaire showed to have factorial validity and internal consistency. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between perfectionism total scale score and item 6 from the temperament scale (“is your baby irritable or fussy?”). Considering MPS 3-factor solution found for pregnancy there was also a statistically significant negative correlation between SOP and the same item. Women with low SOP differed from those with medium and high SOP in the total temperament score. Moreover, the low SOP group differed from the medium group on items three and four scores. There were no significant associations with SPP, which is the dimension more closely associated with negative outcomes. There was an association between anxiety trait status (having it or not) and scoring low, medium or high in the infant temperament scale. The proportion of anxious vs. non-anxious women presenting a high score on the infant temperament scale was higher (24.2% vs. 12.9%). Linear regressions showed that SOP (low vs. medium/high) offered a significant contribution to the prediction of total temperament scale score and items 3 and 4 scores, but a logistic regression did not confirm trait anxiety as a significant predictor of mother's infant temperament perception. Concluding, a major result concerns the fact that higher levels of adaptive perfectionism (i.e. SOP) are associated (and predict) a less negative view of their infant's temperament. These results on the effect of mother's anxiety and perfectionism on the child temperament perception might have treatment implications. As perfectionism is not always maladaptive, some of its positive features could be used to enhance women's self-efficacy/sense of parental competence in their role as mothers and positive affect towards their infants. Also, antenatal interventions aimed at minimising anxiety could help to optimise infant temperament outcomes, which could, eventually, also, lead to subsequent maternal and infant mental health better outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Recently, studies have begun emphasizing paternal involvement during the perinatal period and its impact on maternal health. However, most studies have assessed maternal perception and focused on adolescents or minority groups in Western countries. Therefore, the current study investigated the association between paternal involvement and maternal postnatal depression and anxiety, along with the effects of maternal job status in the Asian society of Taiwan.
Methods
This study recruited pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy as well as their partners on prenatal visits from July 2011 to September 2013 at four selected hospitals in metropolitan areas of Taipei, Taiwan. In total, 593 parental pairs completed the first interview and responded to the follow-up questionnaires until 6 months postpartum. Self-reported data were collected, and multiple logistic regression models were used for analyses.
Results
Lower paternal childcare and nursing frequency was independently associated with an increased risk of maternal postpartum depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) =4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.34–13.98), particularly among unemployed mothers. Furthermore, among unemployed mothers, the risk of postnatal anxiety was 3.14 times higher in couples with fathers spending less time with the child, compared with couples with fathers spending more time (95% CI=1.10–8.98). However, no significant findings were obtained for employed mothers.
Conclusions
The high prevalence of maternal postnatal emotional disturbances warrants continual consideration. Higher paternal involvement in childcare arrangements should be emphasized to aid in ameliorating these maternal emotional disturbances, particularly among unemployed mothers.}

Childbirth can be a traumatic experience occasionally leading to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to assess childbirth-related PTSD risk-factors using an etiological model inspired by the transactional model of stress and coping.
Methods
348 out of 505 (70%) Dutch women completed questionnaires during pregnancy, one week postpartum, and three months postpartum. A further 284 (56%) also completed questionnaires ten months postpartum. The model was tested using path analysis.
Results
Antenatal depressive symptoms (β=.15, p<.05), state anxiety (β=.17, p<.01), and perinatal psychoform (β=.17, p<.01) and somatoform (β=.17, p<.01) dissociation were identified as PTSD symptom risk factors three months postpartum. Antenatal depressive symptoms (β=.31, p<.001) and perinatal somatoform dissociation (β=.14, p<.05) predicted symptoms ten months postpartum.
Limitations
Almost a third of our sample was lost at three months postpartum, and 44% at ten months. The sample size was relatively small. The present study did not control for prior PTSD. The PTSD A criterion was not considered an exclusion criteria for model testing, and the fit index of the ten months model was just below suggested cut-off values.
Conclusions
Screening for high risk pregnant women should focus on antenatal depression, anxiety and dissociative tendencies. Hospital staff and midwives are advised to be vigilant for perinatal dissociation after intense negative emotions. To help regulate perinatal negative emotional responses, hospital staff and midwifes are recommended to provide information about birth procedures and be attentive to women's birth-related needs.}

abstract = {Objective
Maternal cigarette smoking is a recognised risk factor for maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and remains a significant problem in the Irish maternity system. Approximately 11% of Irish women will continue to smoke in pregnancy, despite awareness of the negative impact on their pregnancy. Although recommendations exist for the management of pregnant smokers, information on the antenatal care of Irish smokers in pregnancy has not been described. We reviewed the care given to smokers in a large urban maternity hospital.
Study design
This is a retrospective cohort study of 100 consecutive smokers and 110 contemporaneous non-smokers who delivered at a large urban maternity hospital of over 8200 births per year in Oct–Nov 2017. Data were obtained from both electronic patient records and chart review to ensure comprehensive capture of outcomes.
Results
In general, mothers who smoked were younger (29yrs vs 33yrs p < 0.001) and of higher parity (1.4 vs. 1.0 p < 0.001) than non-smokers. They were less likely to have a planned pregnancy (44.4% vs 79.6%, p < 0.001) and less likely to have taken pre-conceptual folic acid (22.2% vs 58.3%, p < 0.001). These mothers also had a higher rate of history of illicit drug use, particularly cannabis (19.1% vs 0.9%, p < 0.001) and opiates (16.1% vs 0.9%, p < 0.001). Mental health issues were commoner in smokers with 36.3% describing depression, postnatal depression or bipolar disorder and 34.3% experiencing anxiety disorder or panic attacks. Smoking cessation advice was identified in only 36.5% of smokers and no smokers were referred for smoking cessation interventions. Two thirds of smokers were referred for an additional ultrasound, largely due to suspected fetal growth restriction. Infants of smoking mothers had lower mean birthweights (3.16 kg vs 3.47 kg p < 0.001) and mean birth centile (27th vs 47th p < 0.001) than non-smokers. Twenty eight percent of these infants were small for gestational age, an incidence significantly higher than non-smokers at 13% (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Maternal cigarette smoking appears to be a largely tolerated risk factor in the population studied, despite being associated with poor obstetric outcomes. We identified an absence of smoking cessation services and a lack of intervention and structure around care pathways.}

Little is known about the prevalence and comorbidity of Major Depressive Episode (MDE) during pregnancy in the general population. This study presents nationally representative data on the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidities of depression in women during pregnancy and postpartum in the United States.
Method
Data were drawn from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a survey of 43,093 adults aged 18years and older residing in households in the United States of whom 14,549 were women 18 to 50years old with known past-year pregnancy status. Diagnoses of depression and other mood, anxiety, and drug disorders were based on the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule — DSM-IV version.
Results
The overall prevalence of MDE during pregnancy was 12.4%. Among pregnant and postpartum women, depression was associated with younger age, ethnicity other than Latino, being widowed, divorced, separated or never married, traumatic events within the past 12months and pregnancy complication. Strong associations were found between MDE during pregnancy and postpartum and nearly all 12-month psychiatric disorders. Past-year depressed pregnant and postpartum women were more likely than nondepressed pregnant women to use substances (including alcohol, illicit drugs and cigarettes). Past-year pregnant and postpartum women were significantly less likely to receive past-year treatment for depression than nonpregnant women although not after adjusting for background sociodemographic characteristics.
Conclusions
These results indicate that depression during pregnancy and postpartum is associated with a large range of psychiatric disorders. The high frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, the elevated use of any substances and the high rate of unmet needs should be kept in mind when considering the management of depression during pregnancy and postpartum.}

The 3-factor structure can be used in clinical practice to assess perinatal depression in a nuanced fashion. Given that history of depression and anxiety are risk factors for perinatal depression, a thorough assessment of these items in clinical practice is needed.}

Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental well-being. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy.
Methods
Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26–28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26–28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score > 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state ≥ 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates.
Results
Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0µmol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10µmol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being.
Limitation
Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being.
Conclusions
We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy.}

To investigate the impact of gestational exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on offspring neurodevelopment.
Method
This is a cohort study using national register data in Finland between the years 1996 and 2010. Pregnant women and their offspring were categorized into 4 groups: SSRI exposed (n = 15,729); exposed to psychiatric disorder, no antidepressants (n = 9,651); exposed to SSRIs only before pregnancy (n = 7,980); and unexposed to antidepressants and psychiatric disorders (n = 31,394). We investigated the cumulative incidence of offspring diagnoses of depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for the 4 groups from birth to 14 years, adjusting for confounders.
Results
The cumulative incidence of depression among offspring exposed prenatally to SSRIs was 8.2% (95% CI = 3.1–13.3%) by age 14.9 years, compared with 1.9% (95% CI = 0.9–2.9%) in the psychiatric disorder, no medication group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.12–2.82; p = .02) and to 2.8% (95% CI = 1.4–4.3%) in the SSRI discontinued group (HR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.14–2.97; p = .01). Rates of anxiety, ASD, and ADHD diagnoses were comparable to rates in offspring of mothers with a psychiatric disorder but no medication during pregnancy. Comparing SSRI exposed to unexposed individuals, the HRs were significantly elevated for each outcome.
Conclusion
Prenatal SSRI exposure was associated with increased rates of depression diagnoses in early adolescence but not with ASD or ADHD. Until confirmed, these findings must be balanced against the substantial adverse consequences of untreated maternal depression.}

La peur de l’accouchement suscite un intérêt grandissant dans la littérature scientifique, et ce, du fait de son impact sur le vécu de la grossesse, et sur le déroulement de l’accouchement. Cette étude exploratoire cherche à déterminer l’impact de l’optimisme et de l’anxiété sur la peur de l’accouchement. Quatre-vingt douze femmes enceintes ont participé à cette étude.

Les participantes ont répondu à différents questionnaires permettant de recueillir les informations concernant les antécédents psychologiques et gynécologiques et le vécu de la grossesse, et de mesurer la peur de l’accouchement, les symptômes anxio-dépressifs anténataux, le niveau d’optimisme et le niveau de satisfaction de vie. Les résultats indiquent que les facteurs favorisant la peur de l’accouchement sont la primiparité, les complications médicales rencontrées durant la grossesse et la présence d’une symptomatologie anxieuse. Trente-huit femmes (41,3 %) présentaient des symptômes d’anxiété. L’anxiété a un rôle médiateur dans la relation entre l’optimisme et la peur de l’accouchement.

Summary
Background
Each woman experiences childbirth differently. Childbirth can be a positive or a very painful and stressful experience. Many factors can influence pregnancy and the experience of labor. Among these factors, fear of childbirth is known to be an important factor in childbirth outcomes. It may have an effect on labor pain, on the increase of pain relief, on planned caesarean requests and on the development of postpartum depression. Fear of childbirth appears to be more common among nulliparous women, but all pregnant women may have a fear of childbirth (Toohill et al., 2014; Salmela-Aro et al., 2012). Women with both anxiety and depression have the highest prevalence of fear of childbirth but some women with fear of childbirth have no symptoms of anxiety and/or depression (Storksen et al., 2012). Optimism is a trait which may vary over time. When people prepare to confront a difficulty, their state of confidence may be altered, therefore long term stability in optimism is not always high (Carver et al., 2010). Optimism confers benefits on what people are able to achieve (Scheier & Carver, 1992), so it may affect women's perceptions of their ability to cope with labor. Research into fear of childbirth focuses on risk factors but also on protective factors such as optimism (Gourounti et al., 2015). There are, however, inconsistencies in the literature; causes of fear of childbirth are not completely understood. Furthermore, little is known about how positive psychological factors may protect against fear of childbirth. This exploratory study aimed to determine the impact of optimism and anxiety on the fear of childbirth. We were interested in exploring if anxiety is a risk factor for fear of childbirth and if optimism is a protective factor.
Methods
Participants were recruited through maternity care services and maternity care providers’ offices in the South of France. Ninety-two pregnant women participated in the study. Among them, 54 were primiparous and 38 were multiparous. Participants’ average age was 30 years (21–42). All participants were in their third trimester; the duration of pregnancy was from 7 to 9 months. They were asked to complete a set of questionnaires regarding their psychological and gynecological history, their experience of pregnancy (anamnestic survey), their fear of childbirth (the Fear of Childbirth Scale; EPA), their antenatal anxiety and depression symptoms (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), their optimism level (the Life Orientation Test–Revised; LOT-R) and their satisfaction of life (the Life Satisfaction Scale; ESDV).
Results
The level of fear of childbirth was high in this sample (mean score EPA=63.48). Results indicated that factors promoting fear of childbirth were primiparity, medical complications during pregnancy and the presence of anxiety symptoms. In fact, primiparous women were more likely to experience fear of childbirth than multiparous women (mean score EPA=67.63 vs 57.58; P<.01). Women who had complications during pregnancy had higher scores than those without complications (mean score EPA=71.06 vs 59.80; P<.01). Women with anxiety symptoms had higher fear of childbirth scores than those without anxiety symptoms (mean score EPA=68.90 vs 58.39; P<.01). Fear of childbirth was associated with anxiety symptoms in thirty-eight women (41.30%). Variance in fear of childbirth scores was explained in part by anxiety and optimism. Anxiety mediated the relationship between optimism and fear of childbirth.
Conclusion
Anxiety acts as a buffer between optimism and fear of childbirth. A greater understanding of the role of anxiety in the development or in maintenance of fear of childbirth in pregnant women was gained. This current research suggests that clinical interventions which aim to reduce fear of childbirth should pay attention to anxiety symptoms before trying to develop positive strategies such as optimism. Future research should attempt to replicate these findings with a follow-up assessment. Multiple benefits could result when treating fear of childbirth. In fact, decrease in fear of childbirth among pregnant women could positively impact the quality of labor as well as the transition to motherhood and mother–infant bonding.}

To date, there have been few studies of DMDD examining the risk factors during gestation and during the first years of life. We assessed the perinatal and postnatal risk factors associated with the occurrence of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) by 11 years of age.
Methods
Prospective longitudinal study. Mothers completed a standardized questionnaire shortly after childbirth. We used the Development and Well-Being Assessment, administered to the mothers or legal guardians, to identify DMDD among the 11-year-old subjects. We also employed logistic regression to perform bivariate and multivariate analyses, using a theoretical model of conceptual analysis.
Results
We evaluated data related to 3563 subjects at 11 years of age. The prevalence of DMDD was 2.5% (95% CI=2.0–3.0). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the early risk factors for the development of DMDD by 11 years of age were maternal mood symptoms during pregnancy, maternal depression during the first years after childbirth, and low maternal level of education.
Limitations
We were unable to evaluate the genetic characteristics of the family at the birth of each subject, and there were no data available regarding the prenatal or postnatal mental health of the fathers.
Conclusions
The prevalence of DMDD in early adolescence is low and its risk factors are related to potentially modifiable maternal characteristics. Scientific evidence indicates that DMDD is a major predictor of other psychiatric disorders, especially depression and anxiety. Effective prenatal and postnatal mental health care could prevent mental disorders in offspring.}

Introduction
10 à 15 % des parturientes développent une dépression du post-partum (DPP). Une physiopathologie propre la distinguerait des autres formes de dépression. La prise en charge médicamenteuse repose sur des traitements non spécifiques. La fluctuation des taux de neurostéroïdes durant la grossesse et après l’accouchement, et leur action sur le récepteur GABA-A sont des mécanismes étudiés.
Objectif
Décrire l’émergence et évaluer la pertinence de la cible GABAergique dans la dépression du post-partum.
Méthode
Revue systématique de la littérature clinique et pré-clinique à partir de la base de données MEDLINE et des termes : « postpartum depression », « GABA », « ganaxolone », « brexanolone », « allopregnanolone », avant septembre 2019.
Résultats
Les modèles animaux montrent une fluctuation du fonctionnement GABAergique durant la gestation et après la mise bas et une corrélation entre l’allopregnanolone (AP) et la plasticité des GABA-A-r. Les modèles KO pour la sous-unité δ-GABA-A-r présentent des symptômes de dépression et d’anxiété en post-partum. Les études cliniques confirment la cinétique des taux de neurostéroïdes et la modification GABAergique durant la grossesse et après l’accouchement. Les femmes avec antécédent de DPP ont une sensibilité supérieure à la diminution brutale des neurostéroïdes. Plusieurs essais contrôlés randomisés font la preuve d’une efficacité des injections de brexanolone, forme injectable d’allopregnanolone, avec une réponse rapide et prolongée.
Conclusion
La DPP semble associée à une dysrégulation de l’expression des GABA-A-r durant la grossesse et des difficultés à rétablir leur fonctionnement en post-partum. L’approche GABAergique constitue une cible thérapeutique prometteuse.
Introduction
Prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) ranges from 10 to 15 % of parturients. The impact of the PPD is major on the maternal bond and the health of both mother and child. Its physiopathological mechanisms appear to differ from other types of depression. Today, pharmacotherapy is based on nonspecific treatment, and recent therapeutic advances in this field require a comprehensive approach of the implication of the GABAergic system in the development of PPD. Neurosteroid levels during pregnancy and after parturition and the GABA-A-r modulation are thought to be involved in PPD.
Objective
To evaluate if the GABAergic approach is relevant in postpartum depression management.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of literature based on the MEDLINE database with the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): “postpartum depression”, “GABA”, “ganaxolone”, “brexanolone”, “allopregnanolone”, prior to September 2019. We selected articles in English: preclinical and clinical studies, literature review, observational and therapeutic studies.
Results
Preclinical models (mouse and rat) show changes in GABAergic inhibition in the peripartum period and correlation between allopregnanolone and GABA-A-r plasticity. This plasticity in the peripartum period maintains levels of inhibition adapted despite increased neurosteroid levels. KO models for the GABA-A-r δ subunit develop depression and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum period, and a change in the expression of the gene coding for the GABA-R alpha-4 subunit was found. Artificial inhibition of progesterone metabolism during post-partum increased depression symptoms. GABAergic fluctuation seems to be interrelated with other systems such as those of oxytocins. A synthetic neurosteroid (SGE-516) was tested on mouse models of PPD, KO for δ-GABA-A-r or KCC2, and showed decreased depressive symptoms and better mothering. Clinical studies confirm neurosteroid fluctuation and changes in the GABAergic system during the peripartum period. Allopregnanolone is the neurosteroid the most studied in PPD, and it is elevated in the brain during the pregnancy. Studies disagree on the presence of significant differences in allopregnanolone plasma levels during pregnancy or postpartum between women with PPD or not. Women with a history of PPD have greater susceptibility to neurosteroid withdrawal. Imagery and genetical data also show a link between allopregnanolone and PPD. The GABA-A-r may not recover in time following a reduced number during pregnancy, and this mismatch between neurosteroid levels and their receptor may trigger PPD. Several randomized controlled trials investigated brexanolone administrated IV, a synthetic formulation of allopregnanolone, and demonstrated a rapid and well tolerated reduction in depressive symptoms. In March 2019 brexanolone obtained FDA approval in PPD indication under the name Zulresso. However, there are differences in the time of beginning of PPD, which could constitute different subgroups of this disease, and which physiopathology could respond to different mechanisms. Prenatal depression does not respond to a GABAergic approach, but women without any risk factor or previous mood disorder developing PPD in the weeks following childbirth could be particularly responsive to this kind of treatment.
Conclusion
Disability to modulate GABA-A-r expression during pregnancy and restore its previous state after parturition appears to trigger PPD. The GABAergic system is a promising pharmacotherapy target. From preclinical to clinical studies for about twenty years the GABAergic system has been incriminated and targeted in this challenging mental disease.}

La depresión es la principal causa de años perdidos por discapacidad en el mundo, y en mujeres la carga de la enfermedad es un 50% mayor que en varones. La depresión perinatal tiene mayor asociación con ansiedad, cronicidad y discapacidad que en otras etapas de la vida y es poco reconocida a pesar de su alta prevalencia y sus graves efectos en la salud de la madre y el feto. Se realizó un estudio en pacientes ingresadas y valoradas en una unidad de alto riesgo obstétrico en el proceso de implementación del programa durante los meses de enero a junio de 2014; se utilizaron la Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (EPDS) y un cuestionario previamente desarrollado para identificar la presencia de síntomas depresivos y factores de riesgo psicosocial. Se evaluó sistemáticamente a más de 600 mujeres, y se encontró que el 30,2% de las mujeres evaluadas tenían síntomas depresivos según la EPDS y el 3,6% había tenido ideas de autolesión en los últimos 7 días. Los factores relacionados evaluados indican una condición de vulnerabilidad de las mujeres con menor nivel socioeconómico. Los datos encontrados reiteran la importancia de detectar factores que tradicionalmente el personal de salud no identifica ni interviene a lo largo de la vida y particularmente durante la gestación.
Depression is the main cause of years lossed due to disability in the world, and it affects 50% more women 50% than men. Perinatal depression has been linked with more anxiety, a chronic course, and disability than depression in other life stages. In spite of its high prevalence and serious health effects on both mother and foetus, it is frequently under-diagnosed. This study was performed on all high risk obstetric patients admitted to a critical care obstetric unit in Cali, Colombia, from January to June, 2014. Depressive symptoms and psychosocial risk factors were screened by means of a survey and the Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A total of 695 women were included, of whom 30.2% had depressive symptoms on the EPDS, and 3.6% reported having self-injury thoughts in the last 7 days. Our findings are consistent with previous reports on a history of child abuse and family depression as risk factors. It was also suggested that lower socio-economic status is associated with more vulnerability. Early screening is needed to ensure timely detection and treatment.}

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are currently the antidepressant of choice to treat maternal mood disorders. However, little is known about the effects of these medications on the maternal brain and behavior. Therefore, the present study investigated how a commonly used SSRI, fluoxetine, affects neurobehavioral outcomes in the mother using a model of maternal adversity. To do this, gestationally stressed and non-stressed Sprague-Dawley rat dams were treated with either fluoxetine (5mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Dams were divided into four groups: (1) Control+Vehicle, (2) Control+Fluoxetine, (3) Stress+Vehicle and (4) Stress+Fluoxetine. Fluoxetine or vehicle was administered to the dam during the postpartum period via osmotic minipump implants (Alzet) for 28 days. Results show that chronic fluoxetine treatment, after exposure to gestational stress, significantly decreased serum levels of corticosteroid binding globulin and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. In the absence of maternal stress, fluoxetine treatment alone significantly increased maternal arched-back nursing of pups, increased anxiety-related behavior, and decreased serum levels of corticosterone and corticosteroid binding globulin in the dam. This research provides important information on how SSRIs may act on the behavior, physiology, and neural plasticity of the mother. Although this is a first step in investigating the role of antidepressant treatment on the mother, much more work is needed before we can understand and improve the efficacy of these medications to treat mood disorders in pregnant and postpartum women.}

To describe the incidence and duration of breastfeeding for mothers of twins and identify factors that affected this duration.
Design
Secondary analysis of data from a larger longitudinal predictive study of maternal attachment in mothers of twins.
Setting
Paper and pencil questionnaires once during pregnancy and twice in the first 6 months postpartum.
Participants
123 women recruited from a national support group for mothers of twins.
Main Outcome Measures
Mothers’ Information Tool, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Index of Breastfeeding Status.
Results
110 (89.4%) of the sample initiated breastfeeding or initiated a milk supply by pumping. Percentage of breast milk feedings at time 2 predicted whether or not a woman was still breastfeeding at time 3 (odds ratio = 3.63, p < .001).
Conclusion
A high percentage of breastfeeding initiation was found despite the increased care burden that has been described for mothers of twins. Mothers who continued to breastfeed at time 3 provided a high percentage of the twins’ milk feedings as breast milk. The results suggest that mothers who are able to persist with the difficulties of establishing a milk supply for twins and feeding two infants are able to continue providing a high percentage of the infants’ feedings as breast milk.}

Le trouble de l’adaptation est considéré comme un trouble secondaire et invisible selon certains cliniciens. La méconnaissance de la symptomatologie, sa proximité avec le syndrome dépressif ou anxieux et le diagnostic d’exclusion évoqué au sein du DSM-IV permettent d’expliquer ce relatif désintérêt de la part des médecins. Cet article vise, d’une part, à rendre compte des spécificités de ce trouble après avoir parcouru la littérature et, d’autre part, à faire apparaître les premières réactions liées à la nouvelle catégorisation proposée par le DSM-5. Un diagnostic de trouble de l’adaptation bien posé permet un traitement (psychothérapie) adapté et une revalidation rapide.
Introduction
This paper exposes the complexity and discrete characteristic of the adjustment disorder with reference to its clinical and scientific diagnosis. Even though the disorder occurs in frequent clinical circumstances after important life events, such as mobbing, burn-out, unemployment, divorce or separation, pregnancy denial, surgical operation or cancer, the adjustment disorder is often not considered in the diagnosis since better known disorders with similar symptoms prevail, such as major depression and anxiety disorder. Ten years ago, Bottéro had already noticed that the adjustment disorder diagnosis remained rather uncommon with reference to patients he was working with while Langlois assimilated this disorder with an invisible diagnosis.
Methodology
In order to maximize the data collection, we used the article review below and challenged their surveys and results: National Center for Biotechnology Information (NBCI – Pubmed) for international articles and Cairn.info for French literature. Moreover, we targeted the following keywords on the search engine and used articles, which had been published from 1 February 1975 to 31 January 2015: “adjustment”, “adjustment disorder” and the French translation “trouble de l’adaptation”.
Results
One hundred and ninety-one articles matched our search criteria. However, after a closer analysis, solely 105 articles were selected as being of interest. Many articles were excluded since they were related to non-psychiatric fields induced by the term “adaptation”. Indeed, the number of corresponding articles found for the adjustment disorder literally pointed-out the lack of existing literature on that topic in comparison to more known disorders such as anxiety disorder (2661 articles) or major depression (5481 articles). This represents up to 50 times more articles in comparison to the number of articles we found on adjustment disorder and up to 20 times more articles for the eating disorder (1994), although the prevalence is not significantly higher than for the adjustment disorder. According to their relevance and their content, we have split the articles into seven subcategories: 1. General description: most scientific articles generally describe the adjustment disorder as being a transition diagnosis, which is ambiguous, marginal and difficult to detect. The findings claim that only a few studies have been conducted on the adjustment disorder despite a high prevalence in the general population and in the clinical field. 2. Classification: the DSM-5 defined the adjustment disorder as a set of different outcomes and syndromes induced by stress after a difficult life event. While the link to other disorders has not been mentioned, the diagnosis of this disorder is no longer excluded or perceived as a secondary diagnosis. The DSM-5 faced criticism from three points of view: the operationalization of the concept of stress, the differential diagnosis and the description. 3. Prevalence: different samples have shown a significantly high prevalence of the adjustment disorder within the population. In addition to the psychiatric pain induced by difficult life events we need to emphasize the fact that 12.5 to 19.4 percent of the patients faced heavy and severe pathologies and depended on clinical care and treatment. 4. Etiology, comorbidity or associated symptomatology: the literature identified the tendency to commit suicide and stressful life events as being two fundamental characteristics of adjustment disorder. The third one is the personality profile. 5. Differential diagnosis: that motivates researchers to focus on the adjustment disorder: the differentiation approach as to the major depression. Indeed, the aetiology, the symptomatology and the treatment differ from the adjustment disorder. 6. Assessment: very recently, Dutch researchers have developed and validated the Diagnostic Interview Adjustment Disorder (DIAD). 7. Treatment: in 2014, no data or meta-analysis recommended drug treatment in addition to therapy. In fact, several authors have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of drug therapy. The literature suggests a psychotherapeutic approach to treat adjustment disorder.
Conclusion
Emotional reactions triggered by life events are responsible for full therapy agendas and for the rush in emergency rooms and hospitals. The reflex when faced with crying, insomnia or suicidal thoughts to give a diagnostic of major depressive disorder s is generally accepted by everyone. The elevated risk to commit suicide and the approved success of remission or healing through treatment (psychotherapy) are two major reasons why several studies promote the importance and the need to identify the adjustment disorder of our patients.}

En tant que pédopsychiatre, nous savons toute l’importance des interactions mère–enfant dans le développement de l’enfant et la mise en place de la personnalité et ses dysfonctionnements. Qu’en est-il en cas de dépression du péripartum et, en particulier, de la grossesse, quelles spécificités et conséquences pour la mère, pour le développement de l’enfant et les interactions ? Nous proposons ici une synthèse des principaux résultats d’une recherche longitudinale cas-témoin sur les caractéristiques et les effets de la dépression pendant la grossesse et en postpartum (PHRC AOM 02082).
Méthode
Nous avons inclus 205 mères à bas risque (absence de facteurs de risque obstétricaux, grossesse normale, pas de prématurité). Les dépression de la grossesse étaient repérées au troisième trimestre selon les critères du DSMIV, celles du postpartum à deux, six et 12 mois et exclus du groupe témoin. L’anxiété était mesurée par la Stait Trait Anxiety Inventory, le stress par l’échelle de Sensations durant la grossesse et d’évènements de vie ; le nouveau-né était évalué par l’échelle de Brazelton et le comportement socioémotionnelle par le questionnaire d’évaluation socioemotionnelle du jeune enfant (ESEJE). Les interactions mère–enfant étaient explorées à deux mois par le dispositif de double-vidéo de J. Nadel permettant une mise en situation de désynchronisation des interactions.
Résultats
Les dépressions de la grossesse sont plus fréquentes que les dépressions postnatales, sont fortement associées à l’anxiété et aux stress spécifiques de la grossesse malgré les caractéristiques à bas risques de notre population, et affecte dès la naissance le développement de l’enfant, en particulier des garçons. Les dépressions post-natales entraînent des altérations dans la synchronie des interactions et atteignent le bébé dans ses capacités émotionnelles à y réagir.
Conclusion
A partir de ce travail, nous proposons de penser une continuité entre dépression de la grossesse et dépression du postpartum tout en soulignant les risques spécifiques de chaque période. En particulier, la dépression pendant la grossesse pourrait avoir un effet sur le développement du fœtus, et cela de manière différente suivant le sexe, comme montré chez l’animal. Cela pourrait être une des pistes de compréhension pour certains troubles psychiatriques du développement prédominant chez le garçon.
Summary
For a child psychiatrist, interactions between mother and child are of major importance to understand human personality and its dysfunction. However, what about perinatal depression and its consequences for the mother, child and their interaction? The aim of this prospective case-control study summary was to assess, in a same cohort, the effect of pre- and post-natal depression on new born and 1-year-old infant characteristics as related to gender, controlling for confounding variables, and on mother-child interaction at two months (PHRC AOM 02082). We evaluated maternal depression as early as during pregnancy and followed its evolution and consequences regarding psychological development in children and interactions.
Method
We screened 205 pregnant women for depressive symptoms from April 2004 to November 2006. Inclusion in the prenatal depression group was based on meeting DSMIV criteria for major depressive episode. We excluded postnatal depression from the control group by routine screening at two, six and 12 months. Anxiety and stress were respectively assessed on Stait Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and on Sensations during pregnancy and Life Events Questionnaire ; newborn and 1-year-old infant characteristics were evaluated with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) ; early infants responses to non-contingent maternal behaviour were explored by J. Nadel's double video.
Results
Prenatal depression were more frequent than postnatal depression and was highly associated with a feeling of stress and anxiety of pregnancy despite our use of numerous exclusion criteria (at-risk pregnancy, preterm delivery) and had a major impact on child behavioural development, particularly for boys. Post-natal depressions were responsible for interaction synchronism impairment, resulting in difficulties for the newborn in their emotional abilities to react.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that there is a continuity between pre- and post-natal depression, but specific risks and consequences for each period. As in animal studies which have shown sex differences in the impact of prenatal maternal stress on the offspring, depression during pregnancy may affect development in a way that is related to gender. Early gender differences observed to be associated with depression, stress and anxiety during pregnancy may be a key to understanding the higher prevalence in males of child psychiatric disorders.}

abstract = {Background
Insomnia is common during pregnancy but the prevalence and risk factors of insomnia in Chinese women during pregnancy is not well studied. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of insomnia and its risk factors in Chinese women during pregnancy.
Methods
In this cross sectional study, 436 Chinese pregnant women with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) ≥ 8 were clinically assessed using the insomnia criteria based on the combination of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th Edition) and ICD-10 (International Classification of Dieases, 10th Edition). Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS), Pregnancy Pressure Scale (PPS), Perceived physical discomfort level and number, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and a general socio-demographic questionnaire were administered.
Results
The results showed that about 20% of the pregnant women met the strict diagnosis criteria of insomnia. Independent-samples t-test revealed that several risk factors were correlated with the group with insomnia (N = 84) compared to the group without insomnia (N = 352). Binary Logistic regression analysis found that more significant bed partner influence (OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.03–3.60), depressive symptoms (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00–1.14), daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01–1.14), subjective somatic discomfort (OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.11–4.65), kinds of somatic discomfort (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03–1.27) and later gestation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09) were significantly associated with insomnia.
Conclusion
In this cohort of Chinese pregnant women, about a fifth of women suffered from clinically significant insomnia. Measures to prevent the adverse effects of insomnia should be provided to pregnant women with depressive symptoms, Sleep disturbance of the bed partner, excessive daytime sleepiness and somatic discomfort, especially late in gestation.}

abstract = {Study objective
To determine if acute postpartum pain, psychological distress, socioeconomic factors, and labor analgesia were associated with sub-acute pain after childbirth (SAPC; pain starting after childbirth and lasting between four weeks to three months).
Design
Prospective cohort study, from pre-conception to post-partum three months.
Setting
Singapore's major public maternity institution.
Patients
We included women planning to conceive within a year. We excluded women who were pregnant, taking chemotherapy or psychotropic medications, had diabetes mellitus, received assisted fertility interventions or contraception, did not conceive after 12 months, with multiple pregnancies, or who developed obstetric complications.
Interventions
None.
Measurements
We investigated the relationship between average pain score during the three days after childbirth (primary exposure) and incidence of SAPC at postpartum three months (primary outcome). Secondarily, psychological distress at pre-conception (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), Life Experiences Survey (LES)) and second trimester of pregnancy (BDI, EPDS, STAI, PSS, Pregnancy Experience Scale (PES)) were assessed. Baseline maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, labor analgesia, maternal and neonatal outcomes were also collected accordingly.
Main results
Of 317 women who met the study criteria, 30 (9.5%) developed SAPC. Higher average pain score during the three days after childbirth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.82, p = 0.001), use of meperidine for labor analgesia (aOR 4.23, 95% CI 1.03 to 17.43, p = 0.046), higher pre-conception GHQ-12 score (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.27, p = 0.013), and lack of employment with income during pregnancy (aOR 9.62, 95% CI 3.07 to 30.30, p < 0.001) were independently associated with SAPC, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.837.
Conclusions
Higher acute postpartum pain scores, use of meperidine for labor analgesia, poorer pre-conception general psychological health, and lack of employment with income during pregnancy are associated with SAPC.}

abstract = {Background
In the perinatal period, maternal mental health problems and intimate partner violence often co-occur. We aimed to examine associations between psychotropic medication use and intimate partner violence (IPV) in an Australian population-based sample.
Methods
Prospective cohort study of 1507 first-time mothers recruited in early pregnancy (mean gestation 15 weeks) from public maternity hospitals in Melbourne Australia. Follow-up questionnaires at 12 months and four years included validated measures of intimate partner violence (Composite Abuse Scale), and maternal mental health (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, SF-36). Data on use of psychotropic medications was collected using a self-report measure at four years postpartum.
Results
At four years postpartum, almost one in eight mothers (13.9%) were taking psychotropic medication. The prevalence of psychotropic medication use in women experiencing concurrent IPV was considerably higher compared to women not experiencing IPV (25% vs 11%, Odds Ratio = 2.68, 95% CI 1.73–4.15). Women experiencing IPV were significantly more likely to be taking psychotropic medication, even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and depressive symptoms (Adj OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.96). Only 5% of women reporting IPV at four years postpartum had discussed this with a general practitioner.
Limitations
Limitations include use of a self-report measure to assess psychotropic medication use, lack of data on the use of psychological counselling and/or other specialist mental health services and potential for attrition to bias results (addressed using multiple imputation).
Conclusions
Our findings reinforce the need for health professionals treating women for depressive symptoms to inquire about IPV and tailor responses accordingly.}

abstract = {Objective
To prospectively investigate the association of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure through critical windows of pregnancy establishment with fecundability and pregnancy loss.
Design
Prospective cohort study using longitudinal urine measurements of common SSRIs while women are actively trying to conceive.
Setting
Four clinical sites.
Patient(s)
A total of 1,228 women without uncontrolled depression/anxiety, attempting natural conception while participating in a randomized trial of preconception-initiated low-dose aspirin.
Interventions(s)
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Urinary SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram/citalopram) were measured while trying to conceive and, for women who became pregnant, at weeks 0, 4, and 8 of pregnancy. Fecundability odds ratios and incidence of pregnancy loss and live birth were estimated.
Result(s)
A total of 172 women (14%) were exposed to SSRIs while trying to conceive. SSRI exposure was associated with 24% reduced fecundability, and accordingly, a nonsignificant 9% lower live birth incidence, with significantly lower live birth in fluoxetine-exposed women. SSRI exposure was not associated with subsequent pregnancy loss, whether exposure was before conception or at 0, 4, or 8 weeks of gestation, although estimates varied by specific SSRI drug.
Conclusion(s)
Women using SSRIs may have more difficulty becoming pregnant, and although SSRI exposure overall was not associated with pregnancy loss, fluoxetine deserves caution and future study.

Lugar
Cuatro emplazamientos clínicos.
Pacientes
Un total de 1,228 mujeres sin depresión / ansiedad incontrolada, intentando la concepción natural mientras participan en una prueba aleatoria de baja dosis de aspirina iniciada antes de la concepción.
Intervenciones
No aplica.
Medida de resultado principal(s)
Las SSRIs urinarias (fluoxetina, sertralina, escitalopram / citalopram) se midieron mientras trataban de concebir y, para las mujeres que se embarazaron, en las semanas 0, 4 y 8 de embarazo. Se estimaron las ratios de probabilidad de fecundabilidad, la incidencia de pérdida del embarazo y los nacidos vivos.
Resultados
Un total de 172 mujeres (14%) fueron expuestas a SSRIs mientras trataban de concebir. La exposición a SSRI fue asociada con una fecundabilidad reducida del 24%, y, en consecuencia, una incidencia no significativa de nacidos vivos 9% menor, con una significativa baja en nacidos vivos en mujeres expuestas a fluoxetina. La exposición a SSRI no fue asociada con la subsecuente pérdida del embarazo, ya sea que la exposición fue antes de la concepción o a las semanas 0, 4 u 8 de gestación, aunque las estimaciones variaron de acuerdo al fármaco SSRI especifico.
Conclusión
Las mujeres que utilizan SSRIs podrían tener una mayor dificultad para quedar embarazadas, y aunque la exposición a SSRI en general no fue asociada a la pérdida del embarazo, la fluoxetina merece precaución y futuros estudios.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND
The US Food and Drug Administration increasingly uses administrative databases to conduct surveillance of medications used during pregnancy. To assess adverse fetal effects, administrative records must be linked between the mother and infant. The Sentinel Initiative's Mother-Infant Linkage Table provides a large cohort of linked deliveries from national, regional, and public insurance claims in the United States for the US Food and Drug Administration to conduct surveillance.
OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to describe baseline health conditions and prescription medication use during pregnancy in cohorts of women with a live-birth delivery linked and not linked to an infant.
STUDY DESIGN
Live-birth deliveries in women aged 10 to 54 years with at least 391 days of medical and drug coverage before delivery were identified in the Sentinel Mother-Infant Linkage Table from 2000 to 2019. Two cohorts were created for analysis: deliveries linked to infant records (linked deliveries, n=2,320,805) and deliveries unable to be linked to an infant (not-linked deliveries, n=504,785). Baseline health conditions, pregnancy history, healthcare utilization, and pregnancy conditions were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes. Medication exposure was identified in a 90-day prepregnancy period and in each trimester.
RESULTS
Few notable differences were observed between the linked and not-linked deliveries except for maternal age and preterm birth; the not-linked cohort was 3.4 years younger on average and more likely to have a preterm delivery. At baseline among the linked deliveries, the most common conditions were depression and anxiety (5.2% each), acquired hypothyroidism (5.0%), pain conditions (3.9%), and asthma (2.8%). Among linked deliveries, 6.9% had evidence of gestational diabetes mellitus, 3.9% had gestational hypertension, and 4.5% had preeclampsia or eclampsia. The most commonly used medications during pregnancy in the linked deliveries were antibacterials (41.6%) and antiemetics (21.5%); similar medication use patterns were observed in the not-linked cohort. Age trends were observed for some medication groups; anti-infectives, pain medications, and antiemetics were more common in younger mothers, whereas endocrine medications were more common in older mothers.
CONCLUSION
Similarities between the linked and not-linked cohorts suggested that the ability to link mother and infant records is not influenced by maternal health status. In the linked cohort, the prevalence of specific pregnancy complications and medication use were similar to previously reported national estimates. Some baseline comorbidities, such as obesity and smoking, may be underestimated in the Sentinel Mother-Infant Linkage.}

abstract = {Objective
Intractable nausea and vomiting, known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), are relatively common medical problems among pregnant women. Although there are some studies based on psychiatric symptom scales, the relationship between HG and psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and personality disorders, is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there is a difference among women with and without HG with respect to frequency of mood, anxiety and personality disorders.
Methods
The study sample was composed of 52 patients with HG and 90 control pregnant women. Mood and anxiety disorders were ascertained by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Personality disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Revised Third Edition, Personality Disorders (SCID-II).
Results
The prevalence of any mood disorder and any anxiety disorder in women with HG was 15.4% and 36.5%, respectively. In addition, 19 (36.5%) of the patients with HG had at least one personality disorder. According to reports collected from the participants in the study, most of the mood or anxiety disorders occurred before the pregnancy in women with HG. The prevalence of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder was significantly higher in women with HG compared to the control subjects.
Conclusions
The results of the present study suggest that mood and anxiety disorders, and personality disturbances are frequently observed among women with HG and that there is a potential relationship between these psychiatric disorders and HG during pregnancy.}

abstract = {Objectives
To examine the relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the development of mental illness (affective and anxiety disorders) during pregnancy and 1 year postpartum.
Methods
We linked clinical and administrative databases of mothers who delivered in Alberta, Canada, between April 1, 2000, and March 31, 2009, to identify diagnoses of GDM and mental illness. Women with prepregnancy type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. We used generalized estimating equation models to examine the effect of GDM on the development of new-onset mental illness in 2 separate periods: during pregnancy and during the first postpartum year. Generalized estimating equation models were adjusted for age, overweight, smoking, rural residence, ethnicity, median household income, nulliparity, preeclampsia or eclampsia, neonatal death, infant neonatal intensive care unit stay, prior chronic medical conditions and fiscal year.
Results
Of 326,723 pregnancies, 3.7% (12,140) were affected by GDM. Compared to women without GDM, women with GDM had a higher prevalence of, but did not have an increased risk for, new-onset mental illness during pregnancy (16.1% vs. 14.1%; OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13) or postpartum (23.3% vs. 22.1%; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97, 1.10).
Conclusions
In this large population-based cohort of women in Alberta, GDM was not associated with an increased risk for developing new-onset mental illness during pregnancy or postpartum.
Résumé
Objectifs
Examiner la relation entre le diabète sucré gestationnel (DSG) et le développement de la maladie mentale (troubles affectifs et anxieux) au cours de la grossesse et dans l'année qui suit l'accouchement.
Méthodes
Nous avons relié les bases de données cliniques et administratives pour repérer les diagnostics de DSG et de maladie mentale chez les mères qui ont accouché en Alberta, au Canada, entre le 1er avril 2000 et le 31 mars 2009. Nous avons exclu les femmes atteintes du diabète de type 1 ou du diabètede type 2 avant la grossesse. Nous avons utilisé des modèles d'équations d'estimation généralisées pour examiner les répercussions du DSG sur la maladie mentale d'apparition récente lors des 2 périodes suivantes : la grossesse et l'année qui suit l'accouchement. Les modèles d'équations d'estimation généralisées ont été ajustés selon l'âge, l'excès de poids, l'usage du tabac, la résidence en zone rurale, l'ethnicité, le revenu médian du ménage, la nulliparité, la prééclampsie ou l'éclampsie, le décès néonatal, le séjour à l'unité de soins intensifs néonatals et infantiles, les états de santé chroniques antérieurs et l'année financière.
Résultats
Parmi les 326,723 grossesses, le DSG concernait 3.7% (12,140) grossesses. Comparativement aux femmes non diabétiques, les femmes atteintes du DSG avaient une prévalence plus élevée, mais pas de risque accru, de maladie mentale d'apparition récente, durant la grossesse (16,1 % vs 14,1 % ; RIA 1,06, IC à 95 % de 0,98 à 1,13) ou après l'accouchement (23,3 % vs 22,1 % ; RIA 1,03, IC à 95 % de 0,97 à 1,10).
Conclusions
Dans cette vaste cohorte en population générale qui était composée de femmes de l'Alberta, le DSG n'a pas été associé à un risque accru de maladie mentale d'apparition récente durant la grossesse ou après l'accouchement.}

Epidemiological evidence links exposure to stress hormones during fetal or early postnatal development with lifetime prevalence of cardiac, metabolic, auto-immune, neurological and psychiatric disorders. This has led to the concept of ‘developmental programming through stress’. Importantly, these effects (specifically, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and neurodevelopmental and behavioural abnormalities) can be reproduced by exposure to high glucocorticoid levels, indicating a crucial role of glucocorticoids in their causation. However, there can be important differences in outcome, depending on the exact time of exposure, as well as duration and receptor selectivity of the glucocorticoid applied. The mechanisms underlying programming by stress are still unclear but it appears that these environmental perturbations exploit epigenetic modifications of DNA and/or histones to induce stable modifications of gene expression. Programming of neuro- and behavioural development by glucocorticoids and stress are important determinants of lifetime health and should be a consideration when choosing treatments in obstetric and neonatal medicine.}

Cette étude traite de la validation d’une version française de l’ Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, Cox et al., 1987). Les objectifs de cette étude consistent à évaluer, dans les premiers jours après l’accouchement, la valeur du seuil prédictif d’une dépression du post-partum avec l’EPDS et de préciser son seuil pour le dépistage des dépressions majeures du post-partum. Les passations ont été réalisées en 2 temps auprès de mères primipares et multipares dans 3 cliniques privées obstétricales du sud-ouest de la France. Les mères qui présentaient des problèmes psychologiques et bénéficiant d’un traitement étaient exclues de l’étude. Tout d’abord, l’échelle EPDS a été remplie par 859 mères au 3e jour après leur accouchement. Puis, 722 mères ont à nouveau rempli cette échelle entre la 4e et la 6e semaine du post-partum. Parmi ces 722 mères, 131 présentaient une dépression du post-partum. Le diagnostic de dépression a été corroboré par la Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck, 1972), l’échelle de dépression de Hamilton (HDRS, Hamilton, 1967) et le MINI (Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, Lecrubier et al. 1997). Au 3e jour post-partum, nous notons 30 % de mères dont les scores EPDS sont9 et 19 % dont les scores EPDS sont11. Entre la 4e et la 6e semaine post-partum, nous observons 18,1 % de dépression du post-partum, dont 16,8 % de dépression majeure du post-partum. Les analyses factorielles indiquent, au 3e jour du post-partum, une structure composée de 2 sous-échelles, et dans l’évaluation de la dépression du post-partum une structure monofactorielle. L’étude de la sensibilité et de la spécificité au 3e jour post-partum prévoit le score de 9 (sensibilité : 0,88) (spécificité : 0,50) comme la valeur du seuil prédictif de dépression post-partum. L’étude de la sensibilité et de la spécificité entre la 4e et la 6e semaine post-partum prévoit un seuil de 12 pour le dépistage des dépressions majeures du post-partum (sensibilité : 0,91 et spécificité : 0,74). L’étude de la fidélité confirme que l’échelle présente une bonne consistance interne (alpha de Cronbach > 0,80) aussi bien au 3e jour après l’accouchement que dans l’évaluation de la symptomatologie dépressive du post-partum évaluée à partir de la 4e semaine du post-partum. Les résultats psychométriques de l’EPDS sont très satisfaisants. Cette échelle permet à la fois le dépistage précoce des mères à risque de développer une dépression postnatale et, dans les premières semaines du post-partum, celui des mères présentant une dépression du post-partum.
Summary
The postpartum is a high-risk period for the occurrence of anxious and depressive episodes. Indeed, during the first few days after delivery, mothers can present postpartum blues symptomatology : fatigue, anxiety, disordered sleeping and a changing mood. Postpartum depression is characterised by a changing mood, anxiety, irritability, depression, panic and obsessional phenomena. It occurs in approximately 10 to 20 % mothers. The exact prevalence depending on the criteria used for detection. The first symptoms usually appear between the fourth and sixth week postpartum. However, postpartum depression can start from the moment of birth, or may result from depression evolving continuously since pregnancy. We can add that the intensity of postpartum blues is a risk factor that can perturb maternal development. So it is important for health professionals to dispose of predictive tools. This study is a validation of the French version of the EPDS. The aims of the study were to evaluate the postpartum depression predictive value at 3 days postpartum and to determine a cut-off score for major depression. Subjects participating in this study were met in 3 obstetrical clinics in, or in the vicinity of, Toulouse. Mothers with psychological problems, under treatment for psychological problems or mothers whose babies present serious health problems were excluded from the study. The EPDS was presented to 859 mothers (mean age = 30.3 ; SD = 4.5) met at one of the clinics at 3 days postpartum (period 1). They had an EPDS mean score of 6.4 (SD = 4.6) ; 258 (30 %) mothers had an EPDS score ≥9. 82.6 % of these mothers experienced a natural childbirth and 17.3 % a caesarean section ; 51.5 % gave birth to their first child, 36.2 % to their second child and 12.3 % to their third or more. All subjects were given a second EPDS with written instructions to complete the scale during the period 4 to 6 weeks postpartum and return it for analysis (period 2). Between the 4 to 6 weeks postpartum period, 722 mothers replied again to the EPDS. 131 mothers had an EPDS score ≥11 (mean age = 30.3 ; SD = 4.8). They had an EPDS mean score of 13.6 (SD = 3.3). Mothers with probable depression were interviewed and assessed, using the Mini (Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, Lecrubier et al. 1997), the SIGH-D (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale) and the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) in order to diagnose a major depressive episode. They had a HDRS mean score of 13.7 (SD = 5.1) and a BDI mean score of 13.6 (SD = 5). At 3 days postpartum, we observed that 258 mothers (30 %) had an EPDS scores≥9 and 164 mothers (19 %) had an EPDS scores≥11. Between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum, we observed 18.1 % of postpartum depression (EPDS≥11) and 16.8 % (EPDS≥12) of major postpartum depression. The analysis of the sensitivity and the specificity at 3 days postpartum provides a cut-off score of 9 (Sensibility : 0.88) (Specificity : 0.50) as predictive of postpartum depression, for this cut-off score, the type I error is low (5.8 %) but the type II error is more higher (18.9 %). The analysis of the sensitivity and the specificity between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum provides a cut-off score of 12 (Sensibility : 0.91) (Sensibility : 0.74) for the detection of major postpartum depression. Factor analysis shows at 3 days postpartum that the internal structure of the scale is composed of two subscales. The first factor F1 « anxiety » accounts 28 % of the variance and the second factor F2 « depression » accounts 20 % of the variance. Between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum, factor analysis suggests an unidimensional model in the evaluation of postpartum depression which is better than a two factor model. This factor accounts 40 % of the variance. The scale has a good predictive value, and we can observe a significant correlation with the EPDS periods 1 and 2 (r = 0.56 ; p < 0.05). This result shows that the depressive mothers mood intensity predicts a future depressive risk. Furthermore, correlations between EPDS and BDI (r = 0.68 ; p < 0.05) and EPDS and HDRS (r = 0.67 ; p < 0.05) show a good convergent validity. The reliability study confirms the good internal consistency of the EPDS, at 3 days postpartum and in the postpartum depression symptomatology evaluation (Cronbach's Alpha > 0.80). In conclusion, this scale demonstrates good validity and is fast and easy use in obstetrical services, allowing early detection of women who risk to develop postpartum depression and, in the first week of postpartum, of mothers who suffer from a major postpartum depression. The use of the EPDS for an early screening of the risk of postnatal depression which is essential considering the consequences that postnatal depression can have on the development of the infant, on the quality of the relationship within the couple and on other social relationships. Mothers at risk for postnatal depression should be controlled and surveyed by the health professionals in obstetrical clinics.}

abstract = {Background
Postpartum depression and pelvic floor disorders are both common conditions that affect women; however, the association between the 2 has yet to be determined.
Objective
The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of a positive postpartum depression screen in a specialty postpartum perineal clinic, and (2) identify risk factors for postpartum depression in this population.
Study Design
A retrospective chart review was performed of 294 women referred to a specialty postpartum perineal clinic at the University of Michigan from March 30, 2012, through May 3, 2016. Women who completed a new patient intake form, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were included. The prevalence of a positive Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screen (≥10) was determined. Bivariate analyses were used to compare demographics, delivery characteristics, referral indications, and postpartum pelvic floor symptoms between women with and without a positive Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screen. Significant variables identified in the analyses were then used to perform logistic regression to identify factors independently associated with a positive Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale screen.
Results
In all, 15.6% (46/294) of women had a positive postpartum depression screen. Average age was 30.6 ± 4.8 years, average body mass index was 28.9 ± 5.06 kg/m2, 68.0% (200/294) were Caucasian, 79.6% (234/294) were primiparous, and 86.0% (245/285) were breast-feeding. Using multivariable logistic regression, women with a positive postpartum depression screen had higher odds of being non-Caucasian (adjusted odds ratio, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.27–5.832; P = .01), having a history of depression and/or anxiety (adjusted odds ratio, 2.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.23–6.24; P = .01), having been referred for pain (adjusted odds ratio, 2.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–5.49; P = .01), and reporting urinary incontinence during and after pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio, 3.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.57–9.25; P = .003).
Conclusion
Urinary incontinence during and after pregnancy and referral for pain were pelvic floor symptoms independently associated with a positive postpartum depression screen in women referred to a specialty perineal clinic. Therefore, consideration should be given to depression screening in women presenting with perinatal urinary incontinence and persistent postpartum pain, as these women may be at increased risk of developing postpartum depression.}

In this study, we examined the association between intimate partner abuse (IPA) and health concerns and health care utilization in a population-based sample of adult women. Methods: We analyzed data on 2043 women aged 18 to 59 who participated in the 1998 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based health survey that included questions on IPA. IPA was defined as experiencing physical violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Consequences of IPA and self-rated health status and health care utilization of women experiencing IPA were examined. Results: A total of 6.3% of Massachusetts women aged 18 to 59 reported IPA during the past year. Women experiencing IPA were more likely than other women to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Women experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance, but received routine health care at similar rates as other women. Conclusions: These results indicate that women in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for several serious emotional and physical health concerns. Most of these women are in routine contact with health care providers. These findings also suggest that the BRFSS may provide a valuable mechanism for tracking state-based IPA prevalence rates over time.}

keywords = {Infant, Small for gestational age, Infant care, Attention},
abstract = {Background
Evidence suggests that there is an association between being born small for gestational age (SGA) and an increased risk of internalizing and externalizing problems, such as ADHD. Additionally, individuals who report having received a lower quality of maternal care show an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety, and they are generally worse caregivers of their offspring. Therefore, an interaction between the birth weight status and the quality of maternal care perceived by the mother could affect behavioral outcomes of the children.
Aims
Evaluate the influence of being born SGA and parental bonding, as perceived by the mother during her infancy, on the children's behavior at 18months of age.
Study design
Nested cross-sectional study within a Canadian prenatal cohort (MAVAN, Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment) recruited from 2003 to 2010.
Subjects
Data from 305 children who were evaluated at 18months of age.
Outcome measures
Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire — ECBQ and Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment — ITSEA) were included.
Results
Children born SGA whose mothers reported low maternal care during her infancy (using the Parental Bonding Instrument — PBI) showed lower scores in the attentional set shifting trait (ECBQ, p=0.002) and attention construct (ITSEA, p=0.05) at 18months of age. We also found that SGA increases decreases cuddliness (p=0.011) and poor perceived maternal care decreases low intensity pleasure (p=0.016) on the ECBQ.
Conclusions
These findings suggest a complex transgenerational transmission whereby mother's own care interacts with the fetal growth of her offspring to predict its attentional skills at 18months of age.}

Despite high prevalence and severity, the neurochemical basis of FASD remains largely unexplored. The present study evaluated the pharmacological effects of agmatine in cognitive deficits associated with FAS in rat’s offsprings prenatally exposed to alcohol. Pregnant rats received ethanol in liquid modified diet during the entire gestational period of 21 days. Offsprings were treated with agmatine (20–80 mg/Kg, i.p.) during early postnatal days (PND: 21–35) and subsequently evaluated for anxiety in elevated plus maze (EPM), depression in forced swim test (FST) and learning and memory in Morris’s water maze (MWM) during post adolescent phase. Hippocampal agmatine, BDNF, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were also analyzed in prenatally ethanol exposed pups. Offsprings prenatally exposed to ethanol demonstrated delayed righting reflex, reduced exploratory behavior along with anxiety, depression-like behavior and impaired memory. These behavioral abnormalities were correlated with a significant reduction in hippocampal agmatine and BDNF levels and elevation in TNF-α and IL-6 immunocontent. Chronic agmatine (40 and 80 mg/Kg, i.p.) administration for 15 days (PND: 21–35), improved entries and time spent in open arm of EPM, decreased immobility time in FST. It also reduced latency to reach the platform location; increased the number of entries, time spent in platform quadrant and also number of crossing over platform quadrant when subjected to MWM test in prenatally ethanol exposed offsprings. This study provides functional evidences for the therapeutic potential of agmatine in cognitive impairment and other neurological complications associated with FASD.}

abstract = {Aims
The aim of this study was to investigate the association between pregnancy complications, mental health-related problems, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Malaysian women.
Materials and methods
A case–control study of women with T2DM (n=160) matched by age range to controls without T2DM (n=160). Data were collected in the Negeri Sembilan and PutraJaya regions in Malaysia, from two hospital outpatient clinics, PutraJaya Hospital and Tuanku Jaa’far Hospital Seremban, and one health clinic at Seremban. Validated, interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to obtain the data. The unadjusted and adjusted estimates were calculated using the Mantel–Haenszel method.
Results
Neither depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.39–1.41) nor anxiety (RR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.53–1.88) symptoms increased the risk of T2DM significantly. However, gestational diabetes (RR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.02–1.79), and ≥3 pregnancies (RR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08–1.79) were significant risk factors for the development of T2DM. T2DM was not a significant risk factor for either depression (RR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.91–1.74) or anxiety symptoms (RR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.59–2.19).
Conclusion
In this study, T2DM is not a significant risk factor for depression and anxiety; similarly, neither are depression and anxiety significant risk factors for T2DM. Although prevalence of depression and anxiety is not alarming, the findings reported here should alert clinicians to screen and treat anxiety and depression in people with diabetes and also note the importance of monitoring women with complications in pregnancy for risk of later T2DM.}

Methods: An online anonymous survey was emailed between July and August 2020 to all women whose infertility care, including the first consultation for infertility, have been delayed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Feelings about COVID-19 outbreak, lockdown and suspension of fertility care were assessed by Multiple-Choice Questions and Visual Analog Scales. Results: 435 women answered to the survey (response rate 34.6%). Mean levels of the HADS-A (anxiety), HADS-D (depression) and PSS10 were respectively 7.58(±3.85), 4.51(±3.48), and 27(±6.75). Prevalence of stress was 50.8% and almost half of women presented clear or suggestive anxiety symptoms (respectively 21.6% and 25.7%). Stress and anxiety rates were much higher than those expected in infertile population. Increased stress was observed in women above 35 years and those stopped ‘in cycle’ or during pre-treatment for in-vitro fertilization or frozen embryo transfer. Patient with history of depression or anxiety had a higher prevalence of perceived stress (p = 0.0006). Postponement was perceived as ‘unbearable’ for women experiencing stress (p = 0.0032). After the first wave of pandemic, pregnancy desire remained the same and 84.3% of women wanted to resume fertility care as soon as possible. Conclusion: Stopping fertility care during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact on women with an increase of stress, and anxiety. Psychological counseling should always be offered especially during this difficult period.}

abstract = {Objective
Prenatal exposure to stress and fever are factors lowering seizure threshold in animal models. The fever effect on seizure threshold is well documented in human infants, however the associations between maternal perinatal stress and infants’ susceptibility to seizures is unknown. This is the first study in humans to investigate longitudinally, whether in humans, the effect of maternal perinatal emotional symptoms such as stress, anxiety and depression that may trigger a biological stress response on age at first seizure occurrence.
Method
The study sample is a subgroup drawn from a longitudinal follow up cohort (3D cohort study: Design, Develop, Discover, N=2366 mother-infant dyads). Twenty-nine otherwise healthy infants who had a febrile seizure (FS) episode before the last follow-up visit (around 24 months of age) were studied. Mothers completed questionnaires regarding their emotional health at each pregnancy trimester and at three months postpartum. The link between maternal emotional symptoms and infant age at first FS was assessed through correlations and multiple regressions.
Results
We found that maternal anxiety symptoms during the second trimester of pregnancy are linked to the age at first FS (r(23)=−0.459, p=0.021) and explain 21.1% of its variance. Postnatal maternal depression symptoms at 3 months postpartum were also associated with the age at first FS (r(23)=−0.587, p=0.002) and explained an additional 17.6% of variance. Together, the variables explained 38.7% of the variance in age at first FS. Maternal perceived stress symptoms at 3 months postpartum were also linked to the age at first FS (r(23)=−0.418, p=0.038), however, stress did not significantly contribute to the variance of age at first FS..
Significance
Our results suggest a link between increased perinatal maternal emotional symptoms and the age at first FS. An earlier age at first FS may be the manifestation of a lower seizure threshold. Early first seizure occurrence is a risk factor for compromised neurological and cognitive development. Further studies should address the mechanisms by which perinatal maternal emotional symptoms may have an impact on seizure threshold in humans.}

To evaluate the prevalence of suicide risk and comorbidities in postpartum women.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study of postpartum women. The sample comprised mothers who have received prenatal care from the Brazilian National System of Public Heath in the city of Pelotas. Suicide risk and other mental disorders were evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). A yes answer on one of the six interview questions was considered a sign of suicide risk.
Results
The sample consisted of 919 postpartum women. The 11.5% suicide prevalence was 4.62 (CI 2.45, 8.73) times higher in women with low educational levels. Women with comorbid depression or an anxiety disorder showed a 17.04 (CI 2.27; 19.96) times greater risk of suicide than those who did not suffer from any mood disorder.
Conclusion
Lower education levels and psychiatric disorders are associated with suicide risk. Bipolar disorder is the psychiatric disorder with the highest impact on suicide risk.

A amostra foi constituída de mães que receberam cuidados pré-natais prestados pelo Sistema Nacional de Saúde Pública do Brasil na cidade de Pelotas. O risco de suicídio e outros transtornos mentais foram avaliados pela Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Uma resposta afirmativa a qualquer das seis perguntas é considerada um risco de suicídio. Resultados: A amostra consistiu de 919 mulheres pós-parto. A prevalência do risco de suicídio foi de 11,5%. Ela foi 4,62 vezes mais alta (IC de 95% 2,45; 8,73) em mulheres de baixo nível educacional. Mulheres apresentando qualquer comorbidade para depressão e transtornos ansiosos tiveram uma chance 17,04 vezes maior (IC 95% 2,27; 19,96) àquelas que não apresentaram nenhum transtorno afetivo. Conclusão: Um nível educacional mais baixo e a presença de um transtorno psiquiátrico se associam ao risco de suicídio. O transtorno bipolar é o diagnóstico psiquiátrico com maior impacto sobre o risco de suicídio.}

They probably do not have a substantially higher incidence in pregnancy, but they are independently associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes. These include prematurity, low birth weight and an increase in the rate of major malformations. Whilst maternal death arising as a consequence of psychiatric disorder is relatively uncommon, it continues to feature prominently as one of the leading preventable contributors to maternal mortality in the developed world. Conversely, the inappropriate attribution of physical complaints to underlying psychiatric disorder, and the misdiagnosis of delirium as psychiatric disorder, have both been associated with maternal mortality from undiagnosed physical causes. Milder psychiatric disorders presenting in pregnancy can be managed by primary care services, where access to psychological treatments can often be speedier. Women with more severe disorders need specialist care, ideally from a perinatal mental health service sitting within a perinatal mental health network that incorporates a mother and baby unit. Women and their partners should be fully involved in discussions about mental health treatment choices and the balance of risks involved, including the background rate of adverse outcomes that can occur by chance. Decisions about medication should be carefully documented and summarized in a letter written in plain English that is copied to the woman for her information.}

Methods
The study sample was composed of 47 patients with HG. Psychiatric interviews were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (SCID-I). Other psychiatric interviews were performed in the second and third trimesters. On each visit, the subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory.
Results
The prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 25.5%, and the prevalence of any mood disorder was 14.9% in women with HG in the first trimester. Psychiatric disorders continued throughout the pregnancy in two thirds of the women who had HG and a psychiatric diagnosis. Any SCID diagnosis in the first trimester was higher in women whose NV had partially resolved than in women whose NV had fully resolved (P<.05).
Conclusion
The present studies suggest that psychiatric disorders may play a significant role in the etiology of HG. Our findings presented a potential connection between HG and anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. Additionally, the NV symptoms in women with HG and a psychiatric disorder may persist during pregnancy.}

Narcolepsy and control subjects were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression.
Results
The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9).
Conclusions
In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls.}

Twenty-four per cent of these women were judged to be notably ill in a psychiatric sense. This number is thought to be excessively high, although a control study is required to settle this, but in any case is in excess of the prevalence rate for psychiatric disorder in the East African population generally. Depressive reaction were the most common pattern of disturbance, and this is in keeping with the recent realization that depression is a frequent disorder in the rural African. Unfavourable social, economic and domestic patterns inherent in the present transition between traditional and urbanized patterns of life appear to be significant in precipitating many of these psychiatric disorders. If modern antenatal care is to play a complete role in preventing the hazards of pregnancy, it must take account of the traditional beliefs and anxieties of rural African women, and seek to deal with these as they arise.}

abstract = {Background
Maternal mood symptoms have been associated with psychiatric disorders in children. This study aimed to assess critical periods when maternal symptoms would be more deleterious.
Methods
Cohort of 4231 births followed-up in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. Mood symptoms during pregnancy were self-reported by mothers at perinatal interview; and at 3-months postpartum, mothers answered the Self-Reporting Questionnaire. Psychiatric disorders in 6-year-old children were evaluated through the Development and Well-Being Assessment instrument. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression.
Results
Prevalence of mood symptoms in pregnancy was 24.6% (23.2–26.0%) and at three months postpartum 22.5% (21.1–23.9%). Prevalence of mental disorders in children was 13.3% (12.2–14.4%). After adjustment for confounders children of mothers with mood symptoms during pregnancy were 82% more likely of presenting psychiatric disorders than children of mothers that did not (1.82; 1.48–2.25); and the chance of having mental disorders among children whose mothers had positive SRQ-20 at three months postpartum was 87% greater than the observed among children whose mothers had it negative (1.87; 1.50–2.33).
Limitations
Because maternal anxiety/depression may interfere with interpretation of the child behavior, child׳s mental health being obtained by interviewing the mother is a limitation of this study. Lack of information on other risk factors may have lead to residual confounding on the effect of maternal mood symptoms at three months postpartum.
Conclusions
Children of mothers presenting mood symptoms during pregnancy and in the first months postpartum are more likely to present psychiatric disorders at 6 years of age.}

Design
a prospective intervention study.
Setting
antenatal care clinic.
Participants
a total of 74 obese pregnant women in a physically active group and 79 obese women in a physically inactive group.
Measurements
the women kept diaries of their physical activity during pregnancy and answered the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Medical Study Short-Form Health Survey in gestational weeks 15 and 35 and 11 weeks post partum. Physical activity was measured in metabolic equivalents.
Findings
the physically active women experienced fewer depressive symptoms and estimated an improved quality of life during their pregnancies as measured by physical functioning, bodily pain, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and general mental health as compared with the physically inactive women. There were no differences between the groups in gestational weight gain or weight change from early pregnancy to post partum or in prevalence of complications.
Key conclusions
physical activity among obese pregnant women provides better psychological well-being and improved quality of life, but does not prevent weight change.
Implications for practice
staff at Antenatal Care Clinics that face obese pregnant women, should encourage and emphasise the benefits of being physically active throughout pregnancy.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Globally, a growing number of children and adolescents are left behind when parents migrate. We investigated the effect of parental migration on the health of left behind-children and adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Methods
For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, and Popline from inception to April 27, 2017, without language restrictions, for observational studies investigating the effects of parental migration on nutrition, mental health, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and abuse in left-behind children (aged 0–19 years) in LMICs. We excluded studies in which less than 50% of participants were aged 0–19 years, the mean or median age of participants was more than 19 years, fewer than 50% of parents had migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median duration of migration was less than 6 months. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted summary estimates from published reports independently. The main outcomes were risk and prevalence of health outcomes, including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional injuries, substance use, abuse, and infectious disease. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064871.
Findings
Our search identified 10 284 records, of which 111 studies were included for analysis, including a total of 264 967 children (n=106 167 left-behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and adolescents of non-migrant parents). 91 studies were done in China and focused on effects of internal labour migration. Compared with children of non-migrants, left-behind children had increased risk of depression and higher depression scores (RR 1·52 [95% CI 1·27–1·82]; SMD 0·16 [0·10–0·21]), anxiety (RR 1·85 [1·36–2·53]; SMD 0·18 [0·11–0·26]), suicidal ideation (RR 1·70 [1·28–2·26]), conduct disorder (SMD 0·16 [0·04–0·28]), substance use (RR 1·24 [1·00–1·52]), wasting (RR 1·13 [1·02–1·24]) and stunting (RR 1·12 [1·00–1·26]). No differences were identified between left-behind children and children of non-migrants for other nutrition outcomes, unintentional injury, abuse, or diarrhoea. No studies reported outcomes for other infectious diseases, self-harm, unprotected sex, or early pregnancy. Study quality varied across the included studies, with 43% of studies at high or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains.
Interpretation
Parental migration is detrimental to the health of left-behind children and adolescents, with no evidence of any benefit. Policy makers and health-care professionals need to take action to improve the health of these young people.

abstract = {Studies involving alcohol and its interactions with other neurotoxicants represent the focus of several works of research due to the fact that the use of alcohol can sometimes leads to serious health problems. Fetal exposure to alcohol and mercury has a high incidence in some regions of Brazil, where there are pregnant women who are alcoholics and live in mining areas. This work was conducted to examine the effects of combined exposure to ethanol (EtOH) and methylmercury (MeHg) in rats during the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Experimental behavioral animal models/tests were used in order to examine locomotion, anxiety, depression and memory. Pregnant rats received tap water or EtOH 22.5% w/v (6.5g/kg per day), by gavage) during pregnancy and breast-feeding. On the 15th day of pregnancy, some groups received 8mg/kg of MeHg (by gavage). The groups were as follows: control, EtOH, MeHg and EtOH+MeHg. The experimental results showed that the EtOH, MeHg and EtOH+MeHg groups reduced the percentage of frequency and time spent in the open arms entries of the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, when compared to the control group. This result suggests an anxiogenic behavioral response. The MeHg group increased locomotor activity in the arena and the immobility time in the forced swimming test, suggestive of depression-like behavior. The EtOH+MeHg group showed greater reductions in the percentages of frequency and time spent in the open arms entries in the EPM test, suggesting a sedative-behavior since the frequency of enclosed arm entries was affected. In the inhibitory avoidance task, the EtOH+MeHg group reduced the latency of the step-down response onto the grid floor, suggesting a cognitive and behavior dysfunctions. Taken together, the results suggest that EtOH and/or MeHg intoxication during the developing CNS may be a risk for deficits related to locomotor impairment, anxiety, depression and neurocognitive functions. There is a possibility that EtOH may prevent some of the MeHg responses, but the precise mechanism of action involved in this process needs to be considered for future research.}

abstract = {Background
Both preterm delivery and survival rates of very low birth weight (VLBW: <1500g) infants are increasing. To date, the focus on studies about postpartum mental health after preterm birth has been on depression and on women. There is a paucity of research regarding prevalence, risks, and predictors of postpartum anxiety in parents after VLBW birth.
Methods
Parents with VLBW infants and parents with term infants were recruited into the longitudinal HaFEn-study at the three largest centers of perinatal care in Hamburg, Germany. State anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and anxiety and adjustment disorders with a clinical interview one month postpartum. Psychiatric lifetime diagnoses, social support, trait anxiety, stress during birth, socioeconomic status, risks during pregnancy, and mode of delivery were also evaluated. To examine predictors of postpartum state anxiety in both parents simultaneously a multiple random coefficient model was used.
Results
230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. The risk for minor/major anxiety symptoms and adjustment disorders was higher in parents with VLBW infants compared to the term group. The risk for anxiety disorders was not higher in parents with VLBW infants. The most important predictors for postpartum state anxiety were high trait anxiety, the birth of a VLBW infant, high stress during birth, and low social support.
Limitations
Data reported here are cross-sectional. Thus, temporal relationships cannot be established.
Conclusions
Our results emphasize the importance of early screening for postpartum anxiety in both parents with VLBW infants.}

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of mental health (MH) disorders including antenatal and postnatal depression (PND), anxiety and post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized GDM and MH disorders will disproportionately affect individuals from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds.
Methods
A systematic methodology was developed, and a protocol was published in PROSPERO (CRD42020210863) and a systematic review of publications between 1st January 1990 and 30th January 2021 was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were explored using keywords and MeSH terms. The finalised dataset was analysed using statistical methods such as random-effect models, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. These were used to determine odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to establish prevalence using variables of PND, anxiety, PTSD and stress to name a few.
Findings
Sixty studies were finalised from the 20,040 data pool. Forty-six studies were included systematically with 14 used to meta-analyze GDM and MH outcomes. A second meta-analysis was conducted using 7 studies to determine GDM risk among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic women with pre-existing MH disorders. The results indicate an increased risk with pooled adjusted OR for both reflected at 1.23, 95% CI of 1.00–1.50 and 1.29, 95% CI of 1.11–1.50 respectively.
Interpretation
The available studies suggest a MH sequalae with GDM as well as a sequalae of GDM with MH among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic populations. Our findings warrant further future exploration to better manage these patients.

Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress.
Methods
The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night.
Results
We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6–5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8–5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men.
Conclusions
The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.}

Controversy exists over psychological risks associated with unwanted pregnancy and consecutive abortion. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological health of female adolescents following artificial abortion up to 12th week of pregnancy.
Design
The control case study.
Setting
The study was carried out in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Clinical Center Tuzla, in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Participants
We assessed 120 female adolescents. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 17.7 (1.5) years experiencing sexual intercourse in the age of 14–19 years for trauma experiences, presence of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety as state, and anxiety as trait. Sixty adolescents had intentional artificial abortion and 60 had sexual intercourse but did not become pregnant.
Main Outcome Measures
We used the PTSD Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y) for assessment of anxiety in adolescents. Basic socio-demographic data were also collected.
Results
PTSD presented significantly more often in adolescents who aborted pregnancy (30%), than in adolescents who did not abort (13.3%) (odds ratio = 4.91 (95%CI 0.142-0.907) P = 0.03). Anxiety as state and as trait were significantly higher in the abortion group, as the mean (SD) anxiety score of patients was 59.8 (8.9), 57.9 (9.7) respectively, than in non-abortion group 49.5 (8.8), 47.3 (9.9) respectively (t = 6.392, P < 0.001; t = 5.914, P < 0.001, respectively). Adolescents who aborted pregnancy had significantly higher depression symptoms severity 29.2 (5.6) than controls 15.2 (3.3) (t = 8.322, P < 0.001), and they presented significantly more often depression (75%), than adolescents who did not abort (10%) (χ2 = 53.279, P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that only experience of life threatening(s) and injury of other person(s) reliably predicted PTSD, whereas abortion and experience of life threatening(s) reliably predicted depression.
Conclusion
Adolescents who aborted pregnancy presented significantly greater prevalence of PTSD and depression, and significantly greater depression severity and anxiety as state and trait than those who did not abort. Abortion predicted depression only, and did not predict PTSD.}

La gravidanza è considerata un periodo di serenità per la donna, tuttavia essa non rappresenta un fattore protettivo per la depressione perinatale, i cui tassi di prevalenza variano tra l’8,5% e l’11,0% in gravidanza e tra il 6,5% e il 12,9% nel primo anno post partum. Solo una piccola percentuale dei casi viene identificata, sia perché alcuni sintomi vengono erroneamente attribuiti allo stato di gravidanza, sia perché molte donne, nel tentativo di evitare lo stigma, prefericono “soffrire in silenzio”.
Discussione e conclusioni
Dati recenti suggeriscono che uno screening precoce può identificare le donne a più alto rischio per la presenza di alcuni fattori, tra cui una storia personale e familiare positiva per depressione, la presenza di ansia in gravidanza, uno scarso supporto sociale. A oggi, sono stati sviluppati solo pochi interventi preventivi standardizzati per ridurre l’impatto di questa patologia. Il trattamento si basa più sull’esperienza clinica che sulla presenza di specifiche linee guida internazionali: in caso di depressione lieve il primo intervento dovrebbe essere rappresentato dai trattamenti non farmacologici (psicoterapia di supporto, psicoterapia interpersonale breve o cognitivo-comportamentale); nei casi di depressione da moderata a grave è consigliato l’uso di antidepressivi, prevalentemente inibitori selettivi della ricaptazione della serotonina o triciclici, valutando il bilancio fra sicurezza ed efficacia e tenendo in considerazione anche la precedente risposta a una specifica molecola.
Background
Although pregnancy is considered a period of wellbeing for the woman, it is not a protective factor against perinatal depression; prevalence rates of depression range from 8.5% and 11% during pregnancy, and from 6.5% and 12.9% during the first year post-partum. Only few cases are identified, on one hand because many symptoms of depression are interpreted as an effect of pregnancy itself, and on the other hand, because many pregnant women, to avoid a possibile “stigma”, prefer a “silent suffering”.
Discussion and conclusions
Recent data suggest that an early screening could detect women at the highest risk to develop perinatal depression, for the presence of risk factors such as a personal or family history of depression, anxiety during pregnancy, lack of social support. Today, only few standardized preventive interventions have been developed to reduce the impact of this pathology. Treatment is based on clinical experience, rather than on specific international guidelines: for mild depression the first intervention should be a psychotherapy (counselling, interpersonal or cognitive-behavioral therapy); for moderate to severe depression, prescription of a pharmachological treatment should be considered (antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants), weighting risks and efficacy, and taking into account a previous positive response to a specific pharmachological agent.}

abstract = {Objective
There has been no empirical research on the occurrence of antenatal psychiatric morbidity in Maltese women. Epidemiological studies have shown that depressive episodes occur in 10–20% of pregnant women. Furthermore, studies have shown that antenatal psychiatric morbidity can adversely affect maternal and foetal well being.
Method
A random sample of 239 pregnant women were interviewed at booking using a detailed sociodemographic history and the Revised Version of the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R). The CIS-R was again administered at 36 weeks and at 8 weeks postpartum to 95.8% of the women.
Results
Among the 229 women interviewed the point prevalence of all psychiatric diagnosis was 19.2% and the point prevalence of antenatal depression and anxiety disorders was 14.8% and 4.4%, respectively, at 18.6 weeks of gestation. At 36 weeks of gestation, the point prevalence of depressive disorder was 10%. Two thirds of the antenatal depression remitted postpartum.
Conclusion
A significant proportion of Maltese women suffer from psychiatric morbidity during pregnancy. Depressive disorders are the commonest morbidity in this study population. Given the scope of the morbidity and potential impact on obstetric and neonatal outcomes, early detection and treatment are recommended.}

abstract = {Objectives
A multistate analysis found Maine had the second highest average annual increase in maternal opioid use disorder (OUD) at delivery hospitalization during 1999–2012. The objective of our analysis was to estimate the prevalence, maternal characteristics, and geographic distribution of OUD at delivery hospitalization in Maine using recent state-level data.
Study design
Serially collected cross-sectional population-based data.
Methods
We used diagnosis and procedure codes to identify deliveries among hospital discharges in Maine, 2009–2018 (n = 120,764), and to categorize deliveries according to the prevalence of maternal OUD and selected conditions. We assessed linear trends in OUD at delivery and calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for co-occurring maternal conditions.
Results
The prevalence of maternal OUD per 1000 deliveries in Maine increased from 22.7 in 2009 to 34.9 in 2018 (linear trend P value < 0.01), with a mean annual increase of 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9 to 2.4). The following conditions were more prevalent among women with OUD at delivery: hepatitis C, PR = 45.8 (95% CI: 38.8 to 54.2); other drug abuse or dependence, PR = 16.8 (13.4 to 20.9); alcohol abuse and dependence, PR = 8.5 (5.8 to 12.5); nicotine use, PR = 6.0 (5.9 to 6.2); cannabis use, PR = 5.2 (4.6 to 5.9); anxiety, PR = 2.7 (2.5 to 3.2); and depression, PR = 2.7 (2.4 to 3.1). Women with OUD at delivery were also more likely to reside in small rural areas (27.3% vs 22.5%) and deliver in a hospital with a level III nursery (50.6% vs 34.9%).
Conclusions
Maternal OUD now accounts for 1 in 29 deliveries in Maine and commonly occurs with other medical conditions. Prevention and treatment of OUD among reproductive age women in Maine remains needed.}

Malgré les progrès accomplis dans l’aide à l’arrêt du tabac en milieu obstétrical, le pourcentage de femmes enceintes fumeuses demeure trop élevé en France. La connaissance des freins à l’arrêt peut aider la prise en charge de leur sevrage.
Buts
Évaluer la prévalence des troubles dépressifs chez des femmes enceintes fumeuses comparativement aux non fumeuses ; juger de leur impact sur la motivation à l’arrêt du tabac ; vérifier si leur identification peut être réalisée par des sages-femmes au moyen d’outils de repérage.
Matériels et méthodes
Enquête prospective multicentrique portant sur 792 femmes (435 fumeuses et 357 non fumeuses). L’évaluation de la dépression actuelle est faite par le Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ; celle de la motivation à l’arrêt par le test de Richmond.
Résultats
Les femmes enceintes fumeuses, comparativement au non fumeuses, présentent des dépressions plus fréquentes (actuelles : OR=2,4 ; antécédents : OR=2), qui ne modifient pas la motivation à l’arrêt. Elles sont associées à une dépendance nicotinique élevée et à des bas niveaux socioéconomiques. Leur repérage est facilement réalisable par les sages-femmes.
Conclusion
Le dépistage systématique des troubles dépressifs chez les femmes enceintes fumeuses pourrait faciliter le sevrage tabagique.
Summary
Despite the organization of smoking cessation program, the percentage of pregnant smokers remains too high in France. The knowledge of the factors limiting success of the attempt can help the smoking cessation.
Aim
To evaluate the prevalence of depressive disorders in pregnant smokers compared to nonsmokers; assess their impact on motivation stopping smoking; verify their identification can be performed by midwives.
Materials and methods
Prospective multicenter survey on 792 women (435 smokers and 357 non-smokers), the assessment of the current depression is made by the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale, and motivation to quit smoking by the Richmond test.
Results
Pregnant smokers compared to non-smokers, have more frequent depressive disorders (current: OR=2.4; history: OR=2). These problems do not decrease the motivation to quit, they are associated with a high nicotine dependence and low socioeconomic levels. Their testing can be done by midwives.
Conclusion
Systematic screening for depression in pregnant women smoking could facilitate smoking cessation.}

abstract = {Background
The Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS/EPDS) is routinely used in many clinical services to screen for probable distress in antenatal and postnatal women. Typically a single administration of this scale results in a referral to a specialist mental health service if the woman scores above the service's cut-off score on the measure — that is, scores ‘high’. A few postnatal studies have shown, however, that many women when re-tested just a few weeks later no longer score ‘high’. This study explored this phenomenon in a sample of pregnant women, using both the EDS and an anxiety self-report measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale — Anxiety subscale: HADS-A).
Method
164 English-speaking pregnant women attending a local public hospital's antenatal clinic for their first appointment participated. At this appointment they completed the EDS and the HADS-A, and predicted how they might be feeling in about two-week time. Approximately two weeks later they were interviewed by phone and again completed the EDS and the HADS-A, and answered questions about possible mood changes.
Results
Regardless of which of several cut-off scores on the EDS or HADS-A was used to define ‘high’ scorers, approximately 50% (±6%) of women scoring high at their first appointment on either measure no longer scored ‘high’ two weeks later. Common reasons given for their mood improvement included reduced morning sickness, reassuring results from routine tests (e.g., ultrasounds), fear of miscarriage subsiding, and a sense of reassurance following their hospital visit. Many of the women were accurate in predicting at their first appointment that they would be feeling better within a few weeks.
Limitations
The administration procedure for completion of the measures on the two occasions was different. Women initially completed the measures by hand, and on the second occasion over the phone.
Conclusion
Half the women screened as having emotional distress — that is, scoring ‘high’ on self-report mood measures (i.e., EDS and HADS-A) — during their first hospital visit in pregnancy are likely to have transient distress for predictable reasons. Referring women to specialist mental health services based upon just one administration of these measures will therefore result in a large number of unnecessary referrals, thus possibly overstretching the resources available. We therefore believe that when women score high on a self-report mood measure, enquiring as to why this is the case, and about whether the woman expects to feel differently in a few weeks time, together with a second administration of the measures in a few weeks is a better practice, unless there are good clinical reasons to do otherwise. In addition, studies reporting prevalence rates of perinatal distress should not simply use a one-off administration of a self-report mood scale to state the probable rate of disorders or distress.}

abstract = {Background
Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a biomarker that is affected by older age, psychosocial stress, and medical comorbidities. Despite the relevance of these factors to obstetric practice, little is known about LTL in pregnancy. Our study explored longitudinal LTL dynamics in pregnant and non-pregnant people.
Objective
This pilot study compares changes in LTL between pregnant and non-pregnant people over time, explores potential correlations between LTL and mental health measures, and investigates associations between short first-trimester LTL and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Study design
This was a prospective pilot cohort study of nulliparous pregnant and non-pregnant people between ages 18 and 50 who presented for care at a single institution from January to November 2020. Pregnant people were enrolled between 10 and 14 weeks gestation. Participants had two blood samples drawn for LTL; the first on the day of enrollment and the second on postpartum day 1 (pregnant cohort) or 7 months later (non-pregnant cohort). LTL was measured using quantitative PCR. The primary outcome was the difference between pregnant and non-pregnant people in LTL change between the two timepoints (basepair difference per 30-day period). Secondary outcomes included differences in responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and a survey about stress related to COVID-19. Differences in LTL were tested using t-tests and linear regression models, both crude and adjusted for age. A subgroup analysis was conducted within the pregnant cohort to examine whether shorter first-trimester LTL was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted t-tests to compare LTL between people with and without each categorical outcome and computed Pearson correlation coefficients between LTL and continuous outcomes such as gestational age at delivery.
Results
46 pregnant and 30 non-pregnant people were enrolled; 44 pregnant and 18 non-pregnant people completed all LTL assessments. There were no between-group differences in LTL change (−4.2 ± 22.2 bp per 30 days pregnant versus −6.4 ± 11.2 bp per 30 days non-pregnant, adjusted beta 2.1, 95% CI -9.0-13.2, p = 0.60). The prevalence of depression and pandemic-related stress were both low overall. The two groups did not differ in PHQ-9 scores, and no correlations were significant between LTL and PHQ-9 scores. Among the 44 pregnant people, shorter first-trimester LTL was significantly correlated with earlier gestational age at delivery (r = 0.35, p = 0.02).
Conclusion
In this exploratory pilot cohort of reproductive-aged people with low levels of psychological stress, we described baseline changes in LTL over time in pregnant and non-pregnant participants. We found a correlation between shorter first-trimester LTL and earlier gestational age at delivery, which warrants further investigation in a larger cohort.}

Perinatal depression has been linked with more anxiety, a chronic course, and disability than depression in other life stages. In spite of its high prevalence and serious health effects on both mother and foetus, it is frequently under-diagnosed. This study was performed on all high risk obstetric patients admitted to a critical care obstetric unit in Cali, Colombia, from January to June, 2014. Depressive symptoms and psychosocial risk factors were screened by means of a survey and the Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A total of 695 women were included, of whom 30.2% had depressive symptoms on the EPDS, and 3.6% reported having self-injury thoughts in the last 7 days. Our findings are consistent with previous reports on a history of child abuse and family depression as risk factors. It was also suggested that lower socio-economic status is associated with more vulnerability. Early screening is needed to ensure timely detection and treatment.
Resumen
La depresión es la principal causa de años perdidos por discapacidad en el mundo, y en mujeres la carga de la enfermedad es un 50% mayor que en varones. La depresión perinatal tiene mayor asociación con ansiedad, cronicidad y discapacidad que en otras etapas de la vida y es poco reconocida a pesar de su alta prevalencia y sus graves efectos en la salud de la madre y el feto. Se realizó un estudio en pacientes ingresadas y valoradas en una unidad de alto riesgo obstétrico en el proceso de implementación del programa durante los meses de enero a junio de 2014; se utilizaron la Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (EPDS) y un cuestionario previamente desarrollado para identificar la presencia de síntomas depresivos y factores de riesgo psicosocial. Se evaluó sistemáticamente a más de 600 mujeres, y se encontró que el 30,2% de las mujeres evaluadas tenían síntomas depresivos según la EPDS y el 3,6% había tenido ideas de autolesión en los últimos 7 días. Los factores relacionados evaluados indican una condición de vulnerabilidad de las mujeres con menor nivel socioeconómico. Los datos encontrados reiteran la importancia de detectar factores que tradicionalmente el personal de salud no identifica ni interviene a lo largo de la vida y particularmente durante la gestación.}

To examine childhood sexual abuse in Australian childbearing adolescents and the contribution of abuse variables (sexual and physical abuse) to antenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety in adolescents.
Methods
Seventy-nine adolescents proceeding with a pregnancy for the first time were surveyed about abuse experiences and were administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the third trimester and at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum.
Results
The prevalence of physical abuse before the age of 16 years was 20.5% and 9% of adolescents met the criteria for sexual abuse. Overall, 20.5% adolescents experienced some kind of abuse (sexual or physical) and 9% experienced both sexual and physical abuse. An experience of sexual and/or physical abuse was related to depression and anxiety in the postpartum, but not during pregnancy.
Conclusions
The difficulties associated with the transition to parenting may be exacerbated for adolescent childbearers who have a history of abuse, and in turn, may increase vulnerability to experiencing depression and anxiety. Depression and anxiety may increase perceived stress and compromise their functioning and their ability to parent.}

Postpartum depression (PPD) affects women in various sociocultural environments around the world during a sensitive period of their lives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and time course of PPD in a Greek urban environment as well as possible relations of PPD with certain clinical and sociodemographic factors.
Method
The study was performed on a sample of 402 women that were recruited from a university obstetric clinic in Athens, Greece, during the first 24 hours after delivery. The women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale through telephone interviews. The telephone interviews were conducted the first week as well as the first, third, and sixth month after delivery. The first day after delivery, all women completed the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the List of Threatening Experience, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Whitley Index, the Schalling-Sifneos Personality Scale, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. In addition, the Blues Questionnaire was administered the first 3 days and the seventh day after delivery. Other clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained through questionnaires and personal interviews.
Results
A cutoff point of 12 in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to define PPD. Eighty (19.8%) of the women in the sample experienced PPD during the first 6 months after delivery. The development of PPD was related significantly to the following factors: stressful events during pregnancy (P = .01), maternity blues on the seventh day after delivery (P = .01), obsessive preoccupation with cleaning (P = .04), and judgment that the baby is crying excessively at the first month interview (P = .02).
Conclusion
The women's emotional condition before and after delivery, obsessionality, and difficulties in regulating the infant's emotions appear to contribute to the development of PPD during the first 6 months after delivery.}

To review the extant literature on the effect of traumatic experiences that pre-date conception, pregnancy, and the postpartum period (perinatal period) and present a thematic overview of current issues in this relatively new area of inquiry.
Data Sources
Electronic databases Cochrane, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and PubMed were searched. Manual searches of reference lists supplemented the electronic search.
Study Selection
Peer-reviewed articles written in English on the role of posttraumatic stress disorder during the perinatal period were included.
Data Extraction
Key findings relevant to perinatal posttraumatic stress that were reported in primary sources and meta-analyses were organized according to themes, including The Role of Childbirth, Comorbidity With Depression and Anxiety, Risk Factors for Perinatal PTSD, High-Risk Health Behaviors, and Association With Adverse Health Outcomes.
Data Synthesis
Across studies, antenatal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates were estimated between 2.3% and 24%, and observed prevalence rates during the postnatal period ranged from 1% to 20%; however, many researchers failed to assess PTSD that existed before or during pregnancy, and when preexisting PTSD is a controlled variable, postpartum rates drop to 2% to 4.7%. In addition to prenatal depression and anxiety and pre-pregnancy history of psychiatric disorders, history of sexual trauma, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and psychosocial attributes are risk factors for development or exacerbation of perinatal PTSD.
Conclusion
Women's health care providers should evaluate for PTSD in routine mental health assessments during and after pregnancy, especially with a reported history of trauma or the presence of a mood or anxiety disorder. Such screening will allow women to receive needed treatment and referrals and mitigate the potentially negative sequelae of PTSD. Future investigators must recognize the importance of subsyndromal posttraumatic stress symptoms and individual differences in responses to trauma.}

abstract = {Background
Considering the lack of evidence on incidence and continuity of sleep problems from adolescence to young adulthood, this study explores sleep problems’ incidence and their continuation rates from 14 to 21 years.
Methods
Sleep data from the 14-year (n = 4,924) and 21-year (n = 3660) follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort were used. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychological conditions were explored for their role in sleep problems. Modified Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used to identify predictors. Inverse probability weights were used to account for attrition.
Results
Of all subjects, 26.0% of the subjects at 14 years and 28.3% of the subjects at 21 years reported “often” sleep problems, with 41.7% of adolescent sleep problems persisting at 21 years. Perinatal and early-life maternal factors, for example, drug abuse (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.71), smoking, depression, and anxiety, were significant predictors of adolescent sleep problems. Female sex (IRR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.55-2.94), advanced pubertal stages, and smoking were the important predictors of sleep problems at 21 years. Adolescent depression/anxiety supported the continuity of sleep problems (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.40), whereas exercise was seen to exert a protective effect.
Conclusion
This study indicates high rates of sleep problems in young subjects, with around half of sleep problems originating in adolescence persisting in young adulthood. Therefore, early interventions are needed to manage sleep problems in young subjects and prevent further progression to other life stages. Future studies should explore if sleep problems in young adults also persist in later life stages and identify the factors supporting the continuity of sleep problems.}

abstract = {Epidemiological and dietary studies show that nutritional deficit of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) is directly related to the prevalence and severity of depression. Supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) during critical periods of development (pregnancy and lactation) is essential for cortical maturation, synaptogenesis and myelination, and may also mitigate the risk for cognitive deficits and psychopathologies in young adults. The present study was performed to evaluate the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) receptors, particularly of 5-HT1A, and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the antidepressant effect of ω-3 PUFA supplementation. In Experiment 1, the antidepressant effects of fish oil were assessed by the modified forced swim test in adult rats. The data indicated a robust antidepressant effect produced by this supplementation and that treatment of the rats with WAY 100135 reversed this effect. In Experiment 2, cortical and hippocampal contents of BDNF, 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), were determined in animals subjected to the same protocol. Increased BDNF expression in the cortex and hippocampus of both age groups was detected. In 90 day-old rats, 5-HT content in the hippocampus was increased, whereas 5-HIAA formation was diminished in the fish oil group. We suggest the occurrence of a reciprocal involvement of 5-HT1A receptors activation and the hippocampal BDNF-increased expression mediated by fish oil supplementation. These data corroborate and expand the notion that supplementation with ω-3 PUFA produces antidepressant effects mediated by an increase in serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly in the hippocampus.

abstract = {Background
International studies indicate that the median prevalence of psychotic experiences in children is 7%. It has been proposed that environmental stress during pregnancy may affect the neurodevelopment of the foetus and lead to a vulnerability in the child to later stressors and psychopathology.
Aim
In this study we explore the relationship between environmental stress during pregnancy and psychotic experiences in children in the general population at 12years.
Methods
We analysed a birth cohort of 5038 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Environmental stress was measured as life event exposure. Data on life events were collected on women during their pregnancy, whilst psychotic experiences in the offspring were assessed at age 12.
Results
There was a weak association between maternal exposure to life events and psychotic experiences at twelve years (crude OR 1.10 95% CI 1.02–1.18) per quartile of life event score. This association was not reduced after adjustment for socio-economic status, family history of schizophrenia, maternal education or birth weight but after adjustment for maternal anxiety and depression and smoking in early pregnancy there was no longer any evidence for an association (OR 1.01 95% CI 0.93–1.10).
Conclusion
This study provides some evidence to suggest that stressful life events may affect child psychotic experiences through effects on maternal psychopathology, and possibly physiology, during pregnancy.}

abstract = {Background
One in 5 recently deployed US women veterans report overactive bladder symptoms. Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety commonly co-occur in women with overactive bladder, but temporal relationships between these outcomes have not been well studied, and the mechanism behind this association is unknown. The Women Veterans Urinary Health Study, a nationwide longitudinal study in recently deployed women veterans, was designed to better understand relationships between overactive bladder and mental health conditions.
Objective
We sought to estimate the 1-year incidence and remission of overactive bladder and to identify the impact of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and prior sexual assault on 1-year overactive bladder incidence and remission rates.
Study Design
Participants of this 1-year prospective cohort study were female veterans separated from military service who had returned from Iraq or Afghanistan deployment within the previous 2 years. Eligible women were identified through the Defense Manpower Data Center and recruited by mail and telephone. Telephone screening confirmed participants were ambulatory, community-dwelling veterans and excluded those with urinary tract fistula, congenital abnormality, or cancer; pelvic radiation; spinal cord injury; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson disease; stroke; or current/recent pregnancy. Data collection included computer-assisted telephone interviews performed at enrollment and 1 year later. The interview assessed demographic and military service characteristics; urinary symptoms and treatment; depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and treatment; and a lifetime history of sexual assault. Overactive bladder was identified if at least moderately bothersome urgency urinary incontinence and/or urinary frequency symptoms were reported on Urogenital Distress Inventory items. Exposures included depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and lifetime sexual assault, assessed at baseline using validated questionnaires (including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist). Associations between exposures and overactive bladder incidence and remission were estimated using propensity score adjusted logistic regression models.
Results
In all, 1107 (88.0%) of 1258 eligible participants completed 1-year interviews. Median age was 29 (range 20-67) years and 53% were nulliparous. Overactive bladder was identified at baseline in 242 (22%), and 102 (9.2%), 218 (19.7%), 188 (17.0%), and 287 (25.9%) met criteria for baseline depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and lifetime sexual assault, respectively. At 1 year, overactive bladder incidence was 10.5% (95% confidence interval, 8.6–12.8%), and remission of overactive bladder was 36.9% (95% confidence interval, 30.8–43.4%). New overactive bladder occurred more often in women with baseline anxiety (21% vs 9%), posttraumatic stress disorder (19% vs 9%) and lifetime sexual assault (16% vs 9%) (all: P < .01). After adjustment, anxiety (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–4.1) and lifetime sexual assault (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.8) predicted 1-year incident overactive bladder. Overactive bladder remission occurred less often in those with baseline depression (19% vs 41%, P < .01) and anxiety (29% vs 42%, P = .03). After adjustment, depression decreased 1-year overactive bladder remission risk (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.83). Overactive bladder treatment was uncommon and not associated with remission.
Conclusion
Anxiety, depression, and prior sexual assault–common postdeployment problems for women veterans–influence the natural history of overactive bladder. Providers should screen for mental health conditions and sexual assault in women with newly diagnosed or persistent overactive bladder.}

But de l’étude
La grossesse peut être considérée comme une période de vulnérabilité particulière. Le trouble psychopathologique le plus fréquemment observé chez les femmes enceintes est la dépression prénatale. Cette étude vise à évaluer l’existence de symptômes dépressifs et de troubles psychosociaux associés dans un échantillon de femmes enceintes françaises.
Patients et méthode
La dépression (EPDS, Cox et al., 1987 [30]), l’anxiété (STAI-Y, Spielberger, 1983 [38]), la détresse psychologique (GHQ-12, Goldberg, 1978 [36]) et le soutien social perçu (SSQ6, Sarason et al., 1983 [40]) ont été évalués chez 126 femmes enceintes.
Résultats
Le taux de dépression prénatale observé dans cet échantillon correspond à une prévalence élevée (19,8 %). Les femmes jeunes, célibataires et avec le niveau d’étude le plus faible semblent être les plus vulnérables à la dépression prénatale. L’anxiété, la détresse psychologique et le faible support social perçu sont liés à des symptômes dépressifs plus marqués.
Conclusion
À l’image des résultats mis en évidence dans la littérature internationale, il est possible de définir un profil de vulnérabilité pour la dépression prénatale, qui peut permettre d’améliorer son repérage lors du suivi de la grossesse. L’utilisation de l’EPDS dans sa forme prénatale doit être encouragée, dans le but de repérer et traiter précocement ces symptômes dépressifs, afin de prévenir l’émergence de troubles interactifs précoces mère-enfant.
Aim of the study
Pregnancy can be seen as a higher vulnerability period. Prenatal depression is a common psychopathological complication among pregnant women. This study evaluates the presence of prenatal depressive features and its psychosocial correlates in a French sample.
Patients and method
One hundred and twenty-six pregnant women were assessed for depression (EPDS, Cox et al., 1987 [30]), anxiety (STAI-Y, Spielberger, 1983 [38]), psychological distress (GHQ-12, Goldberg, 1978 [36]) and perceived social support (SSQ6, Sarason et al., 1983 [40]).
Results
The high rate of prenatal depression in this French sample (19,8%) is consistent with that found in the international literature. Young, single and low educated women appeared to be more vulnerable to prenatal depression. Anxiety, psychological distress and perceived social support were related to a great extend to depression.
Conclusion
Consistent with previous international studies, a vulnerability profile could be defined to potentially enable better screening in the course of prenatal care. The use of EPDS in its prenatal form ought to be encouraged in French population, in order to improve early recognition and treatment of depressive features and to avoid first mother-baby bonds troubles.}
