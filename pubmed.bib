  abstract = {This study explored the prevalence of prenatal and postpartum depression in Korea and its influencing factors from 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks postpartum. Using a prospective cohort study design, data on women's depression and its influencing factors were collected at 20, 28, and 36 weeks of pregnancy and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postpartum. The participants were 219 women and 181 spouses during pregnancy; and 183 mothers and 130 spouses after childbirth. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and influencing factors were measured by the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised, parity, and spousal depression. The prevalence of maternal depression was 10.5\% to 21.5\% before birth, and it was 22.4\% to 32.8\% postpartum. The prevalence slightly decreased during the prenatal period but peaked at 2 weeks postpartum. Antenatal depression was influenced by low socioeconomic status, lower self-esteem, having experienced prenatal depression, having experienced prenatal anxiety, a previous history of depression, lower social support, lower marital satisfaction, and higher life stress. The factors influencing postpartum depression were lower self-esteem, having experienced prenatal depression, having experienced prenatal anxiety, lower social support, lower marital satisfaction, and higher life stress, as well as infant temperament and maternal blues. Parity and spousal depression had no impacts. The prevalence and influencing factors of maternal depression changed over time. Nurses need to screen women accordingly during the perinatal period and should provide education or counseling to prevent depression and promote adjustment to parenthood.}

  abstract = {Background and objectives: Urinary incontinence is any involuntary loss of urine. It may result in anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and social isolation. Perineal massage has spread as a prophylactic technique for treating complications during labor. Acknowledged effects of perineal massage are reduction of incidence and severity of perineal tear and use of equipment directly related to the intrapartum perineal trauma. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of massage in urinary incontinence prevention and identification of possible differences in its form of application (self-massage or by a physiotherapist), with the previous assumption that it is effective and that there are differences between the different forms of application. Materials and Methods: A controlled clinical trial with a sample of 81 pregnant women was conducted. The participants were divided into three groups: a group that received the massage applied by a specialized physiotherapist, another group that applied the massage to themselves, and a control group that only received ordinary obstetric care. Results: No differences were identified in the incidence or severity of urinary incontinence among the three groups. The severity of the incontinence was only affected by the body mass index and the weight of the baby at the time of delivery. Conclusions: A relationship between perineal massage interventions and development of urinary incontinence has not been observed.}

  abstract = {Pregnancy is a very complex and highly stressful time in which women become more physically and emotionally vulnerable. Therefore, mothers are more likely to face decreased self-esteem and increased postpartum depression. Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, more than 50 \% of mothers are undiagnosed or untreated, showing an urgent need to explore an effective preventive strategy. A healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity have been suggested to be associated with an increased quality of life in pregnant and postpartum women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether swimming exercise before and during pregnancy can affect maternal care and postpartum depression-related behaviors in dams. To this end, female NMRI and C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to swimming exercise before conception and throughout pregnancy. On postpartum days 1-2, maternal behavior including nest building, active nursing, and licking/grooming were monitored. A battery of behavioral tests was also used to measure depression-related symptoms including anhedonia- and anxiety-like behavior, social behavior, and behavioral despair. To identify the underlying mechanisms, corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines during late pregnancy, and corticosterone and brain serotonin during the postpartum period were measured in dams. The findings indicated that swimming exercise increased gestational corticosterone, decreased maternal care and brain serotonin, and increased all depression-related behaviors in postpartum C57BL/6 J dams, while only increased licking/grooming and social behavior, and reduced anhedonia-like behavior in postpartum NMRI dams. Taken together, this study suggests that swimming exercise before and during pregnancy could alter maternal care and postpartum depression-like behavior in a strain-dependent manner.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of symptoms of PMADS among Black women. Black women completed a paper survey between August 2019 and October 2019. Binomial logistic regression was employed to examine predictors of PMAD symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms of PMADs was 56\%. A higher proportion of women with PMADs had experienced depression (16\% vs. 32\%, p = 0.006); physical (18\% vs. 31\%, p = 0.030), emotional (35\% vs. 61\%, p = 0.000), or sexual abuse (12\% vs. 29\%, p = 0.002); and symptoms of depression or anxiety before pregnancy (18\% vs. 46\%, p = 0.000). After adjusting for socio-demographics in multivariate analysis, experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety before pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.445, p = 0.001) was positively associated with experiencing symptoms of PMADs, whereas higher levels of self-esteem (aOR = 0.837, p = 0.000) were negatively associated with experiencing symptoms of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. The prevalence of PMAD symptoms among this sample of Black women was alarmingly high. Women who experienced PMADs were more likely to report adverse childhood experiences (e.g., physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse). By understanding the prevalence of PMADs and the factors associated with these disorders, healthcare professionals can improve diagnosis and treatment rates among this understudied and underserved population.}

Depression is a robust predictor of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and engagement in HIV care; perinatal depression may affect upwards of 47\% of women in SA. Evidence-based, scalable approaches for depression treatment and ART adherence in this setting are lacking. Twenty-three pregnant women with HIV (WWH), ages 18-45 and receiving ART, were randomized to a psychosocial depression and adherence intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect on depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Assessments were conducted pre-, immediately post-, and 3 months post-treatment, and included a qualitative exit interview. Most (67.6\%) eligible individuals enrolled; 71\% completed at least 75\% of sessions. Compared to TAU, intervention participants had significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms at post-treatment, {$\beta$} = - 11.1, t(24) = - 3.1, p \textexclamdown{} 0.005, 95\% CI [- 18.41, - 3.83], and 3 months, {$\beta$} = - 13.8, t(24) = - 3.3, p \textexclamdown{} 0.005, 95\% CI [- 22.50, - 5.17]. No significant differences in ART adherence, social support, or stigma were found. Qualitatively, perceived improvements in social support, self-esteem, and problem-solving adherence barriers emerged as key benefits of the intervention; additional sessions were desired. A combined depression and ART adherence intervention appears feasible and acceptable, and demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy in a high-need population. Additional research is needed to confirm efficacy and identify dissemination strategies to optimize the health of WWH and their children. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03069417.

This was a cross-sectional study on 150 women (with a 100\% response rate) hospitalized for ectopic pregnancy et al.-Zahra hospital in Tabriz, Iran, during 2018-2019, and recruited via convenience sampling. Data were collected using the General Health Questionnaire-28, which has four subscales (overall score range: 0 to 84; subscale score range: 0 to 21 with a lower score indicating a better mental state), and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (score range: - 10 to + 10 with a higher score indicating higher self-esteem). To determine the association between self-esteem and mental health, independent t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression were used. The response rate was 100\%. The mean score (SD) of participants' mental health was 31.4 (8.5), and that of self-esteem was 4.5 (3.80). The percentage of participants who were considered as having mental distress (i.e., overall GHQ-28 score {$\geq$} 24) was 76\%. Among the subscales of mental health, social dysfunction was the most prevalent (observed in 100\% of the participants), followed by somatic symptoms (79.3\%). Lower self-esteem was significantly associated with overall mental distress (odds ratio (OR): 0.74; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 0.64-0.87; P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), depression (OR: 0.70; 95\% CI: 0.60-0.80; P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and anxiety/insomnia (OR: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.66-0.87; P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Mental distress was common among women with ectopic pregnancy. This study is the first to examine the relationship between self-esteem and mental health among women with ectopic pregnancy and highlights the important role of self-esteem in mental wellbeing among those women.}

Record linkage of routinely collected Scotland-wide administrative databases covering prescriptions [prescribing information system (PIS)], hospitalizations (Scottish Morbidity Records 01 and 04), maternity records (Scottish Morbidity Records 02), deaths (National Records of Scotland), annual pupil census, school absences/exclusions, special educational needs (Scottish Exchange of Educational Data; ScotXed), examinations (Scottish Qualifications Authority) and (un)employment (ScotXed) provided data on 766 237 children attending Scottish schools between 2009 and 2013 inclusively. We compared educational and health outcomes of children receiving antidepressant medication with their peers, adjusting for confounders (socio-demographic, maternity and comorbidity) and explored effect modifiers and mediators. Compared with peers, children receiving antidepressants were more likely to be absent [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.90, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.85-1.95] or excluded (adjusted IRR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.29-1.69) from school, have special educational needs [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95\% CI 1.65-1.90], have the lowest level of academic attainment (adjusted OR 3.00, 95\% CI 2.51-3.58) and be unemployed after leaving school (adjusted OR 1.88, 95\% CI 1.71-2.08).

Higher absenteeism partially explained poorer attainment and unemployment. Treatment with antidepressants was less common among boys than girls (0.5\% vs 1.0\%) but the associations with special educational need and unemployment were stronger in boys. Children receiving antidepressants fare worse than their peers across a wide range of education and health outcomes. Interventions to reduce absenteeism or mitigate its effects should be investigated.}

A total of 305 uncomplicated, singleton pregnant women were enrolled during early third trimester. All participants were interviewed regarding baseline demographic, social, economic, family, and obstetric characteristics. Fear of childbirth (FOC) was evaluated by Thai version of Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire Version A (W-DEQ). W-DEQ scores and level of FOC were compared between various characteristics to determine possible associated factors. Mean W-DEQ score was 51.9. Prevalence of low, moderate, high, and severe FOC were 18.4\%, 64.9\%, 16.1\%, and 0.7\%, respectively. Mean FOC score was significantly higher in women with unplanned than planned pregnancy (p = .033). Women with high to severe FOC were significantly less likely to have adequate income (p = .03), have family support (p = .02), have been told about delivery (p = .03), and have witnessed delivery (p = .01). IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Prevalence of fear of childbirth (FOC) in Western countries varies from 8 to 27\%. FOC have been related to several unwanted conditions, including obstetrics complications, operative vaginal delivery, increased analgesic use in labour, elective caesarean section, postpartum depression, and impaired maternal-infant relation. Several factors related to FOC have been reported, including maternal age, parity, gestational age, history of a vacuum or forceps extraction, previous caesarean section, previous adverse perinatal outcome, low education, low socio-economic level, psychiatric problems, personality, lack of social support, and low self-esteem. What do the results of this study add? Prevalence of low, moderate, high, and severe FOC in Siriraj Hospital were 18.4\%, 64.9\%, 16.1\%, and 0.7\%, respectively. This was relatively lower than those reported from Western countries. Mean FOC score was significantly higher in women with unplanned than planned pregnancy. High to severe FOC was significantly related to low financial and family support and less understandings on delivery process. Differences in the results might be partly due to the differences in study population characteristics of Thais, including ethnics, religions, beliefs, perceptions, social structures, and social norms. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Future researches are suggested to explore and understand more about social and cultural factors associated with FOC. Identification of women with high or severe degree of FOC could help in preparing the women at risk before or during pregnancy to lessen FOC in order to improve their childbirth experiences. In addition, effective interventions to reduce FOC should be developed, evaluated, and implemented in the future.}

However, ADS have rarely been investigated in Thailand. This study aimed at exploring the prevalence of ADS and factors associated with these symptoms among Thai women in late pregnancy. A cross-sectional study including 449 women in late pregnancy was carried out. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to detect depressive symptoms with a score of 10 points or higher. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial risks were measured in association with ADS. Percentage and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the prevalence of ADS. Odds ratio (OR) and 95\%CI were used to determine ADS-related risk factors among women. The prevalence of ADS was 46.8\% (95\%CI 42.3-51.4). Pregnant women aged less than 20 years (OR 2.58, 95\%CI 1.14-5.84) and those not having enough money (OR 2.71, 95\%CI 1.22-6.05) had an increased risk of ADS. Psychosocial risks related to ADS for women were low psychological well-being (OR 3.12, 95\%CI 1.75-5.58), low self-esteem (OR 2.08, 95\%CI 1.24-3.49), and low sense of coherence (OR 1.82, 95\%CI 1.12-2.95). The prevalence of ADS among Thai women in their late pregnancy is high. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial factors are independently associated with ADS. Healthcare providers in Thailand should consider EPDS as a standardised screening tool for ADS and use it at antenatal care clinics. Implementing programs focusing on both pregnant women and their family might increase the prevention of perinatal depression.}

We used Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores and linear regression investigated predictors of higher (worse) scores.115 (41\%) and 29 (30\%) PHIV and HIV-affected young people were male, median age was 16 [interquartile range 15,18] and 16 [14,18] years and 241 (85\%) and 71 (74\%) were black African, respectively. There were no differences in anxiety and depression scores between PHIV and HIV-affected participants. Predictors of higher anxiety scores were a higher number of carers in childhood, speaking a language other than English at home, lower self-esteem, ever thinking life was not worth living and lower social functioning. Predictors of higher depression scores were male sex, death of one/both parents, school exclusion, lower self-esteem and lower social functioning. In conclusion, HIV status was not associated with anxiety or depression scores, but findings highlight the need to identify and support young people at higher risk of anxiety and depression.}

No studies to date have observed maternal depression and suicide at immediate prenatal and early postpartum stages. In total, 213 Chinese women were recruited in hospitals after they were admitted for childbirth. All completed a short-term longitudinal survey at perinatal stages. Women reported lower depression scores (6.65) and higher suicidal ideation incidence (11.74\%) after childbirth. Prenatal depression raised the possibility of prenatal suicidal ideation, while prenatal depression and suicidal ideation increased postpartum depression and suicidal ideation. At immediate prenatal stage, marital satisfaction protected women from depression, while miscarriage experiences and self-esteem increased the risk. At early postpartum stage, in contrast, being first-time mother, marital satisfaction, and harmony with mother-in-law prevented them from depression. Our study is among the first to confirm that women have decreased depression but increased suicidal ideation at early postpartum, and a causal relationship between them, which are worthy of public attention. Potential protective (marital satisfaction, being first-time mother, and harmony with mother-in-law) or risk factors (miscarriage experiences and self-esteem) of maternal depression and suicidal ideation are identified at perinatal stages. This offers reliable guidance for clinical practice of health care.}

Depression symptomatology at 1 week, child care stress, and maternal self-esteem were non-significant. Single women and women from ethnic minority backgrounds were underrepresented in the sample. A large proportion of women experience sustained postpartum anxiety. High perceived stress and low partner social support can be used to facilitate early identification of women likely to experience persistent anxiety in the postpartum period and suggest the need for urgent access to psychotherapeutic services for these women. These factors may also be potential targets for individual or couples therapy to treat postpartum anxiety.}

  abstract = {Objectives More than 10 \% of pregnant women in the United States (U.S.) suffer from depression, which has far-reaching consequences on maternal and fetal well-being. There is conflicting evidence regarding the prevalence of antenatal depression among different race and ethnic groups. This systematic review aimed to summarize the existing literature concerning racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence and correlates of antenatal depression in the U.S. Methods PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched online for research studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals until March 2015, using a pre-designed search strategy. Eligibility was determined using pre-specified criteria; and quality was assessed. Results Forty-one (41) articles met the criteria; 13 were cross-sectional, and 21 were longitudinal studies. Overall, the prevalence of antenatal depression was 10-30 \%; it was higher among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Few studies looked at the correlates of depression by race/ethnicity. Among employed women, higher depression scores were observed among NHBs, compared to NHWs; while there was no racial difference among unemployed women. Racial difference and race-employment interaction disappeared once discrimination was accounted for. In another study, higher parity, higher stress, and lower self-esteem were significant correlates of depression among NHBs, while less satisfaction with social support, and higher stress predicted higher depression scores among NHWs and Hispanics respectively. Conclusions The findings of our review suggest that not only is antenatal depression a major public health issue that needs to be addressed, but different racial/ethnic groups seem to differ in their vulnerability and risk factors.}

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to explore whether IPV 12 months before and/or during pregnancy is associated with poor psychosocial health. From June 2010 to October 2012, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 antenatal care clinics in Belgium. Consenting pregnant women were asked to complete a questionnaire on socio-demographics, psychosocial health and violence in a separate room. Overall, 2586 women were invited to participate and we were able to use data from 1894 women (73.2\%) for analysis. Ethical clearance was obtained in all participating hospitals. We found a significant correlation between IPV and poor psychosocial health: within the group of women who reported IPV, 53.2\% (n = 118) had poor psychosocial health, as compared to 21\% (n = 286) in the group of women who did not report IPV (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Lower psychosocial health scores were associated with increased odds of reporting IPV (aOR 1.55; 95\% CI 1.39-1.72), with adjustments made for the language in which the questionnaire was filled out, civil/marital status, education and age. In other words, a decrease of 10 points on the psychosocial health scale (total of 140) increased the odds of reporting IPV by 55 \%. When accounting for the 6 psychosocial health subscales, the analysis revealed that all subscales (depression, anxiety, self-esteem, mastery, worry and stress) are strongly correlated to reporting IPV. However, when accounting for all subscales simultaneously in a logistic regression model, only depression (aOR 0.87; 95 \% CI 0.84-0.91) and stress (aOR 0.85; 95 \% CI 0.77-095) remained significantly associated with IPV. The association between overall psychosocial health and IPV remained significant after adjusting for socio-demographic status. Our research corroborated that IPV and psychosocial health are strongly associated. Due to the limitations of our study design, we believe that future research is needed to deepen understanding of the multitude of factors involved in the complex interactions between IPV and psychosocial health.}

However, more than half of all cases are not detected by healthcare providers. Screening for postnatal depression has not been given importance in maternal health programs in India. Our objective was to screen for postnatal depression among women attending a rural hospital in India, immediately postpartum and at 6-8 weeks post-delivery, and to study associated factors. A cross sectional study was done on 123 postnatal women attending a rural maternity hospital in Karnataka, South India, of whom 74 women were interviewed within one week of childbirth, and 49 women at 6-8 weeks post-delivery. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to screen for postnatal depression. About 45.5\% of the women screened positive for postnatal depression (44.6\% of all subjects within one week of delivery and 46.9\% at 6-8 weeks after delivery). Postnatal depression was significantly associated with mood swings during antenatal period, staying with the family of birth during pregnancy and away from their husbands, and was significantly higher among women who perceived their life as stressful and having a low self-esteem (P\textexclamdown 0.05). This study found a high prevalence of postnatal depression in women in rural Karnataka. This underlines the need for incorporating screening for postnatal depression in the routine care of women during pregnancy and delivery.}

This pilot project tested the hypothesis that subjective social status (SSS) of pregnant women predicts variation in birth weight between Mexican immigrant and Mexican-American women. 300 low-income pregnant Mexican immigrant and Mexican-American women in South Texas were surveyed for SSS, depression, pregnancy-related anxiety, perceived social stress and self-esteem and subsequent birth weight. No significant difference in SSS levels between pregnant Mexican immigrant and Mexican-American women were found. However, SSS better predicted variation in birth weight across both groups than mental and psychosocial health variables. Results suggest distinct relationships among SSS, mental and psychosocial health that could impact birth weight. They underscore the relevance of a multilevel, biopsychosocial analytical framework to studying LBW.}

Thus, it is important to examine risk factors, correlates and course patterns of anxiety and depressive disorders during pregnancy and after delivery. In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n=306 expectant mothers were recruited from gynaecological outpatient settings in Germany and completed up to seven waves of assessment from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum. Anxiety and depressive disorders and potential risk factors/correlates were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V), medical records and additional questionnaires. Although peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders appeared to be persistent in some women, others reported major changes with heterogeneous courses and shifts between diagnoses and contents. There was a considerable amount of incident disorders. Strongest predictors for peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders were anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy, but psychosocial (e.g. maternal education), individual (e.g. low self-esteem), and interpersonal (e.g. partnership satisfaction, social support) factors were also related. Knowing the aims of the study, some participants may have been more encouraged to report particular symptoms, but if so, this points to the importance of a comprehensive assessment in perinatal care. Peripartum time is a sensitive period for a considerable incidence or persistence/recurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders albeit the course may be rather heterogeneous. Interventional studies are needed to examine whether an alteration of associated factors could help to prevent peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders.}

The results of the study are in agreement with the literature considering social and family support and the presence of anxiety and/or depression during pregnancy as main risk factors for PPD. In disagreement with previous studies on risk factors for depressive disorders, we found that the economic status was not associated to PPD.}

However, mental health care is not a component of routine hospital-based antenatal care for medically high-risk pregnant women. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the hospital-based implementation of a Web-based integrated mental health intervention comprising psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for antenatal inpatients. This study is a quasi-experimental design. Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they are (1) \textexclamdown 37 weeks gestation, (2) admitted to the antenatal inpatient unit for \textquestiondown 72 hours, (3) able to speak and read English or be willing to use a translation service to assist with completion of the questionnaires and intervention, (4) able to complete follow-up email questionnaires, (5) \textquestiondown 16 years of age, and (6) not actively suicidal. Women admitted to the unit for induction (eg, \textexclamdown 72-hour length of stay) are excluded. A minimum sample of 54 women will be recruited from the antenatal high-risk unit of a large, urban tertiary care hospital. All women will complete a Web-based psychosocial assessment and 6 Web-based CBT modules. Results of the psychosocial assessment will be used by a Web-based clinical decision support system to generate a clinical risk score and clinician prompts to provide recommendations for the best treatment and referral options. The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence at 3-months postpartum; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment and 3-months postpartum. Qualitative interviews with 10-15 health care providers and 15-30 women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The study was funded in September, 2014 and ethics was approved in November, 2014. Subject recruitment will begin January, 2015 and results are expected in December, 2015. Results of this study will determine (1) the effectiveness of an integrated Web-based prenatal mental health intervention on maternal and infant outcomes and (2) the feasibility of implementation of the intervention on a high-risk antenatal unit. This study will provide evidence and guidance regarding the implementation of a Web-based mental health program into routine hospital-based care for women with medically high-risk pregnancies.}

Common mental disorders were assessed using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Intimate partner violence was defined as psychologically, physically and sexually abusive acts committed against women by their partners. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were estimated for the association studied utilizing logistic regression analysis. The most common form of partner violence was psychological. The prevalence of common mental disorders was 71.0\% among women who reported all form of violence in pregnancy and 33.8\% among those who did not report intimate partner violence. Common mental disorders were associated with psychological violence (OR 2.49, 95\%CI 1.8;3.5), even without physical or sexual violence. When psychological violence was combined with physical or sexual violence, the risk of common mental disorders was even higher (OR 3.45; 95\%CI 2.3;5.2). Being assaulted by someone with whom you are emotionally involved can trigger feelings of helplessness, low self-esteem and depression. The pregnancy probably increased women`s vulnerability to common mental disorders.}

To assess the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was applied. To assess the psychosocial variables the Rosenberg Self-Assessment Scale, Marital Communication Questionnaire and the Berlin Social Support Scale and authors' Socio-demographical questionnaire were used. To assess the normal distribution the Shapiro-Wilk test was used. For non-parametric tests the Mann Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis ANOVA were used due to the distribution of the variables tested against the intergroup comparisons that deviate from the normal distribution. Co-existence of anxiety and depression in different trimesters amounted relatively to 12.7\% in the first trimester, 10.8\% in the second trimester and 12.4\% in the third trimester of pregnancy. Symptoms of anxiety were often experienced by unmarried women, non-working women, and those respondents who estimated their housing and financial situation as being worse. Those most susceptible to depressive symptoms were tested women with primary education and those who assessed as worse their financial and housing situation. Higher self-esteem, good communication in a relationship, satisfying social support was associated with a lower incidence of anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.

Compared with Non-asthmatic women (NA), Asthmatic (A) women reported lower rates of excellent health status (45\% A vs. 65\% NA, P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), were more likely to be overweight or obese (68\% A vs. 50\% NA, P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), and were more likely to have smoked cigarettes during their first pregnancy (25\% A vs. 17\% NA, P \textexclamdown{} 0.01). Psychological measures (psychosocial hassles, low self-esteem, depression) were reported more often in asthmatics than non-asthmatics. Also, asthmatics reported a higher incidence of gestational diabetes (10\% A vs. 6\% of NA, P = 0.05), preterm births (25\% A vs. 16\% NA, P \textexclamdown{} 0.01), and had a higher proportion of low birth weight infants (20\% A vs. 13\% NA, P = 0.03) compared with non-asthmatics. As predicted, asthmatics had poorer biobehavioral risk factors and outcomes compared to non-asthmatics. These findings illustrate the need to target asthmatic women of reproductive age, particularly in this largely rural setting, with interventions to reduce biobehavioral risk factors as part of a strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes.}

Response rate was 93/8. Data collected through a questionnaire with 2 parts meeting broad socio-economic characteristics of the respondents and health- related abortion consequences. Tehran hospitals were the site of study. The results revealed that at least one-third of the respondents have experienced psychological side effects. Depression, worrying about not being able to conceive again and abnormal eating behaviors were reported as dominant psychological consequences of abortion among the respondents. Decreased self-esteem, nightmare, guilt, and regret with 43.7\%, 39.5\%, 37.5\%, and 33.3\% prevalence rates have been placed in the lower status, respectively. Psychological consequences of abortion have considerably been neglected. Several barriers made findings limited. Different types of psychological side effects, however, experienced by the study population require more intensive attention because of chronic characteristic of psychological disorders, and women's health impact on family and population health.}

  abstract = {We have relatively limited knowledge of symptomatic aspects of the postmenopause, rather than perimenopause. We tried to determine the factors associated with experiencing menopausal symptoms by Korean postmenopausal women. A total of 657 Korean women who underwent a natural menopause completed multiple questionnaires, which included questions regarding their attitudes to menopause, depressive symptoms, state anxiety, self-esteem, dyadic relationships, sociodemographic variables, and 11-item Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Multiple regression analyses were performed to collectively examine the relative impact of each independent variable on the quality of life, as determined by the MRS. Decreased severity of menopausal symptoms was associated with more time spent in education, an employed status, a history of pregnancy, longer postmenopausal duration, positive attitudes to menopause, higher state anxiety, heightened self-esteem, and higher dyadic consensus. Increased severity of menopausal symptoms was also associated with absence of a partner, alcohol consumption, a history of hormone replacement therapy, a history of probable premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and increased severity of depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, attitudes to menopause, a dyadic relationship with a partner, and the inner psychological status can be associated with the severity of menopause symptoms specifically in Korean postmenopausal women.}

Continuation was negatively associated with thoughts of being overweight before pregnancy. Remission was positively associated with thoughts of being overweight before pregnancy and negatively associated with overvaluation of weight. Onset of BED in pregnancy was associated with psychological, social and weight-related factors, as well as health behaviors and adverse life events. In women with prepregnancy BED, thoughts of being overweight before pregnancy and overvaluation of weight were associated with course of BED during pregnancy.}

This study examined prevalence and patterns of depressive symptoms among 181 urban, low-income, first-time, African American adolescent mothers recruited from urban hospitals following delivery. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at 6 (N=148; 82\%) and 24 (N=147; 81\%) month home visits. Depressive symptoms were measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Half of mothers (49\%) had BDI scores \textquestiondown 9 at baseline, with significant correlations between BDI scores across all visits (r=0.28-0.50). Depressive symptom trajectories analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling revealed three trajectories of depressive symptoms: Low (41\%), Medium (45\%), and High (14\%). The high depressive symptom group reported lower self-esteem, more negative life events, and lower parenting satisfaction than the low and moderate depressive symptoms groups. Depressive symptoms were self-reported and not verified with a clinical interview. Findings are limited to urban, low-income, African American adolescent mothers and may not be generalizable to other populations. The high prevalence and relative stability of depressive symptoms through 2years of parenting suggest the need for early identification and treatment of maternal depressive symptoms. Brief screening for maternal depressive symptoms conducted during pediatric well-child visits is a feasible and effective method for identifying mothers with depressive symptoms, however, screening measures can not differentiate between high and low levels of depressive symptoms. Brief intervention may be an effective treatment for mothers with mild symptoms of depression; mothers with moderate to severe symptoms may require more intensive intervention.}

Subjects were participants enrolled in a parenting program that provided comprehensive multidisciplinary medical care to teen mothers and their children. Baseline data of a prospective cohort study were collected by interview at 2 weeks postpartum and follow-up, and standardized measures on entry into postnatal parenting groups. Demographic data included education, social supports, psychological history, family history and adverse life events. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children short version (CES-DC). The Maternal Self-report Inventory (MSRI) measured perceived maternal self-esteem, and Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire measured social support. Data were analyzed with bivariate analyses and linear regression modeling focusing on depressive symptoms as the outcome variable. In the 168 teen mothers, mean age 17.6 +/- 1.2 years, African American (50\%), Latina (31\%) or Biracial (13\%), the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 53.6\%. In the linear model, controlling for baby's age, teen's age, ethnicity, Temporary Aid for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC), and previous suicidal gesture, increased depressive symptoms were associated with decreased perceived maternal caretaking ability (P = 0.003) and lower social support (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). In a linear model controlling for the same variables, MSRI total score (P = 0.001) and social support (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) contributed significantly to the model as did the interaction term (MSRI x Social Support, P = 0.044). Depression is associated with decreased maternal confidence in their ability to parent and decreased perceived maternal social support, with a possible moderating effect of social support on the relationship of maternal self-esteem and depression.}

Cross-sectional design with convenience sampling (n=85) of adolescents at 4-6 weeks postpartum, recruited from two community hospitals. Approval was received from the university's IRB (institutional review board), each recruitment site, the adolescent mothers, and their parents or guardians. Data were collected by a research assistant during home visits using a battery of self-report instruments to measure macro, meso, and microsystems of social support. Demographics, exposure to community violence (macrosystem), social support, social network (mesosystem), and perceived stress, mastery, and self-esteem (microsystem) were predictor variables. Depressive symptoms were measured by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) Scale. Variables from each system were significant predictors of depressive symptoms but perceived stress was the strongest predictor. Many postpartum adolescents reported that they had been victims of violence. Significant symptoms of depression were identified in 37\% of the postpartum adolescents. Context is important to consider in comparing international studies of social support. Researchers and clinicians should investigate variables associated with the low incidence of treatment for depressive symptoms in postpartum adolescents. Feelings of high self-esteem and mastery should be fostered in nursing interventions with postpartum adolescents and routine screening for symptoms of depression should be considered in relevant healthcare settings.}

Participants included a volunteer, convenience sample of expectant mothers who completed behavioral and mental health self-report questionnaires. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). Three risk domains were analyzed in relation to depressive symptoms: sociodemographics, family relations, and psychosocial functioning. Forty-seven percent of expectant mothers scored at or above the widely accepted clinical cutoff score of 16 on the CES-D; 30\% scored at or above 20, a score more likely to reflect elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents; and almost 20\% scored at or above 28 (one standard deviation above the mean), a score suggestive of clinical depression. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with less use of public assistance, external locus of control, less social support, and lower self-esteem. Data suggest that a large proportion of pregnant AI adolescents reported elevated depressive symptoms, though rates are similar to non-pregnant AI adolescent samples.}

  abstract = {Given that the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal depression is high, with estimates around 13\%, and the consequences serious, efforts have been made to identify risk factors to assist in prevention, identification and treatment. Most risk factors associated with postnatal depression have been well researched, whereas predictors of antenatal depression have been less researched. Risk factors associated with early parenting stress have not been widely researched, despite the strong link with depression. The aim of this study was to further elucidate which of some previously identified risk factors are most predictive of three outcome measures: antenatal depression, postnatal depression and parenting stress and to examine the relationship between them. Primipara and multiparae women were recruited antenatally from two major hoitals as part of the beyondblue National Postnatal Depression Program 1. In this subsidiary study, 367 women completed an additional large battery of validated questionnaires to identify risk factors in the antenatal period at 26-32 weeks gestation. A subsample of these women (N = 161) also completed questionnaires at 10-12 weeks postnatally. Depression level was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Regression analyses identified significant risk factors for the three outcome measures. (1). Significant predictors for antenatal depression: low self-esteem, antenatal anxiety, low social support, negative cognitive style, major life events, low income and history of abuse. (2). Significant predictors for postnatal depression: antenatal depression and a history of depression while also controlling for concurrent parenting stress, which was a significant variable. Antenatal depression was identified as a mediator between seven of the risk factors and postnatal depression. (3). Postnatal depression was the only significant predictor for parenting stress and also acted as a mediator for other risk factors. Risk factor profiles for antenatal depression, postnatal depression and parenting stress differ but are interrelated. Antenatal depression was the strongest predictor of postnatal depression, and in turn postnatal depression was the strongest predictor for parenting stress. These results provide clinical direction suggesting that early identification and treatment of perinatal depression is important.}

Prenatal interviews were conducted at 16-28 weeks gestation with 324 pregnant women from rural prenatal clinics in the southeastern United States; 43\% were African American, 31\% were Caucasian, and 26\% were Hispanic. Multivariate logistic regression tested the contributions of psychosocial risks and psychosocial and spiritual resources to risk for depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II scores \textquestiondown or=16) for the aggregate and for each racial-ethnic group. Beck Depression Inventory-II scores indicating risk for depression were found in 33\% of the women. There were no significant differences in symptom rates among African Americans, Caucasians, and Hispanics (37\%, 25\%, and 36\%, respectively). African American race, abuse, more stress, less social support, less self-esteem, and less spirituality were associated with risk for depression, controlling for sociodemographic factors. A third of this diverse group of rural low-income women were at risk for depression in pregnancy. It is vital to screen for depressive symptoms in pregnancy and to identify psychosocial risks and resources associated with risk for depression in order to develop interventions for pregnant women with depressive symptoms.}

As part of a longitudinal postpartum depression study, a population-based sample of 594 women completed mailed questionnaires at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum. Among women with depressive symptomatology at 1 week postpartum, diverse variables distinguished between those whose symptoms persisted or remitted at 8 weeks. These variables included recent immigrant status, psychiatric history, premenstrual symptoms, vulnerable personality, low self-esteem, child abuse history, and insufficient support. Variables that distinguished between women with depressive symptomatology at 8 weeks postpartum who previously exhibited symptoms at 1 week postpartum and those who did not included vulnerable personality, life stressors, perceived stress, insufficient support, and partner conflict. To address both the benefits and potential harms of early screening, positive screening scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale should also include an assessment of each individual woman's risk for postpartum depression and (or) chronic major depression.}

Women who agreed to participate in the research answered three self-administered questionnaires: the GHQ30, the Rosenberg Self Esteem, and one for demographic characteristics at 14 gestational weeks. In order to determine DV prevalence rate during pregnancy, the Japanese version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) for measuring severity of DV was provided to those women over 35 gestational weeks. Two hundred seventy nine women answered all questionnaires. 15 of the 279 respondents (5.4\%) were DV positive during pregnancy based on the Japanese version of the ISA. Nine had experienced physical violence, and twelve had non-physical violence Compared with women who had not experienced DV during pregnancy, DV positive pregnant women were more likely to be multipara (OR = 3.9) and to have experienced physical violence in the past from a different partner (OR = 9.1). Moreover, general illness (OR = 3.8), sleep disturbance (OR = 5.8), anxiety (OR = 6.3), depression (OR = 11.5) and low self-esteem (P = 0.02) were identified as effects of DV on women's mental health. Some 5.4\% of women in Japan, approximately 1 in every 20, may experience DV during pregnancy. This is associated with parity and a past history of DV as demographic characteristics, and has an adverse impact on mental health, especially depression. Development of a support system for screening, intervention and referral for DV sufferers is urgently needed.}

Higher levels of stress, lower levels of self-esteem and social support, and higher religiosity had a significant relationship with more symptoms of depression. This supports the need to routinely screen for and to assess factors associated with depressive symptoms in pregnant low-income women.}

Partially randomized patient preference trial in a Scottish Teaching Hospital was conducted. The hospital anxiety and depression scales were used to assess emotional distress. Anxiety levels were also assessed using visual analog scales while semantic differential rating scales were used to measure self-esteem. A total of 368 women were randomized, while 77 entered the preference cohort. There were no significant differences in hospital anxiety and depression scales scores for anxiety or depression between the groups. Visual analog scales showed higher anxiety levels in women randomized to surgery prior to abortion (P \textexclamdown{} 0.0001), while women randomized to surgical treatment were less anxious after abortion (P \textexclamdown{} 0.0001). Semantic differential rating scores showed a fall in self-esteem in the randomized medical group compared to those undergoing surgery (P = 0.02). Medical abortion at 10-13 weeks is effective and does not increase psychological morbidity compared to surgical vacuum aspiration and hence should be made available to all women undergoing abortion at these gestations.}

Risk factors of interest were gender, parental marital status, socioeconomic status, family relationship, parental drug addiction, peer group, loneliness, self-esteem, and school performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors associated with each risk behavior. The risk behaviors leading to traffic accidents were rarely or never having worn a seat belt (30.6\%) or helmet while bicycling (66.9\%) and while motorcycling (50.1\%), riding with drivers who had consumed alcohol (18.8\%), and driving after consuming alcohol (12.1\%). The studied group carried weapons (8.5\%) and has been involved in a violent event (31.5\%). Among 13.9\% who were assaulted, 6.7\% needed hospitalization; rape was reported by 2.4\%. Depression was reported by 19.9\%, with 12\% having suicidal tendencies and 8\% attempting suicide. The lifetime use vs. heavy use prevalence of substance abuse, respectively, was: 15.4\% and 3.5\% for smoking, 37.3\% and 1.7\% for alcohol, 37.8\% and 4.6\% for amphetamine use, and 37.9\% and 0.1\% for other drugs. Among the 10\% who have had sexual intercourse, 1\% were homosexual, 7.1\% have never used a condom, and 2.1\% resulted in pregnancy. Being male was a risk factor for every untoward behavior except depression. Other risk factors included poor self-esteem, poor school performance, and early school leaving. Factors relating to the family included a low socioeconomic status, poor relationships, broken families, and parental substance abuse. Socioenvironmental factors included being in a gang and loneliness. Some risk behaviors started at younger than 8 years old. Schools and media were given as the sources of information regarding sex, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and substance abuse. The prevalence of six major-risk behaviors in adolescents in Bangkok was significantly high. Several risk factors were identified, the knowledge from which may help to form preventive measures in this population.}

  abstract = {The Vulnerability Personality Style Questionaire (VPSQ), a 9-item self-report personality scale, was developed to identify women at-risk for postpartum depression due to personality vulnerability. Preliminary research with this scale suggests it has satisfactory psychometric properties. The purpose of this methodological study was to further examine the psychometric properties of the VPSQ in a sample of Canadian women. As part of a longitudinal study, women completed postal questionnaires at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum that included the VPSQ, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Rosenburg Self-Esteem Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Five hundred and ninety-four women returned questionnaires suitable for analysis. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the VPSQ was 0.67 and significant correlations between the VPSQ and self-esteem (r = 0.58) and perceived stress (r = 0.55) scales were found, providing evidence for construct validity. In a logistic regression analysis, VPSQ was predictive of developing depressive symptomatology 1, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum; an increase of one point on the VPSQ increased the risk of developing postpartum depression 1.3 fold. The results from this study support the overall utility of the VPSQ. As such, this brief instrument is ready to assist in the identification of women at-risk of developing postpartum depression such that appropriate secondary preventive or treatment interventions may be initiated.}

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a social support intervention delivered to pregnant adolescent girls between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation in preventing symptoms of depression at 6 weeks postpartum. The study used a repeated measures design. Data were collected at a teenage parenting program, an educational option of the public school system. Participants (n = 128) were pregnant and postpartum adolescents. Symptoms of depression at 6 weeks postpartum. Participants completed the Postpartum Support Questionnaire, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem instrument, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression instrument at baseline, then were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups (pamphlet, video, or pamphlet plus video) or the control group. The content of the intervention was based on a synthesis of the literature describing social support needed and desired by postpartum adolescents. No significant differences were found in Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression instrument scores among the groups at 6 weeks postpartum. Using path analysis, the authors found that predictors of symptoms of depression at 6 weeks postpartum were (a) receiving more support from friends, family, and others and (b) having low self-esteem. These findings differ from earlier studies, and both research and clinical implications are discussed.}

  abstract = {This study was designed to determine the predictors of postpartum depression. One hundred- sixty one women within one year after delivery from one public health center located in the northern area of Seoul were used in this study. The instruments were a survey of general characteristics, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, recent life events index, perceived social support from family, Quality of marriage index, parenting stress index, and Rosenberg's self-esteem inventory. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and logistic regression. The average item score of the EPDS was 6.67. 12.4\% of respondents, who scored above a threshold 12, were likely to be suffering from a depression of varying severity. The fitness of the model for explaining postpartum depression from six variables, plan for pregnancy, family support, quality of marital relation, perceived social support, life events, childcare stress, and self-esteem, was statistically significant and the predictive power of these variables was 90.9\%. The significant predictors of postpartum depression were family support and child care stress. Further research is needed to identify the prevalence rate of postpartum depression using more reliable sampling methods from a large general population. Nursing interventions need to be developed for promoting family support and reducing childcare stress.}

A total of 512 mothers during the 6th postpartum week were recruited by means of convenience sampling from Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County aboriginal tribes in Taiwan and Fuzhou City in China. Five self-report instruments were used to collect data. Significant differences of stress, social support, self-esteem, depression, and health-promoting lifestyles were found among the three groups. Stress, social support, and self-esteem were the significant predictors of postpartum depression for women living in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Stress and self-esteem were the significant predictors of postpartum depression for female aborigines living in Pingtung County, Taiwan. Education, social support, and self-esteem were the significant predictors of postpartum depression for women living in Fuzhou, China. These findings serve as a reminder that when considering postpartum depression mechanisms, one should not disregard cultural mediators. Also, there is evidence that the new mother's self-esteem is transculturally important with regard to the susceptibility to postpartum depression.}

A quantitative study with a prospective correlational research design. Women attending three prenatal clinics in East Tennessee. 120 pregnant women between 16 and 28 weeks gestation. The majority of the clinics' clients were from rural Appalachia. Multiple logistic regression statistical analysis revealed that women with symptoms of depression, lower levels of self-esteem, or a negative perception of pregnancy had significantly higher odds of delivering a preterm baby. These findings suggest the importance of screening for psychosocial risk factors in pregnancy. Interventions to address these psychosocial risks could improve maternal psychosocial health, maintain continuity of midwifery care, and reduce the incidence of preterm birth.}

African American adolescent females (n = 522) completed a survey that assessed body image using a 7-item scale (alpha = 0.71) and a face-to-face interview that assessed sexual behaviors. In logistic regression analyses, controlling for depression, self-esteem and body mass index (BMI), adolescents who were more dissatisfied with their body image were more likely to fear abandonment as a result of negotiating condom use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.3, p = 0.02), more likely to perceive that they had fewer options for sexual partners (AOR = 2.4, p = 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as having limited control in their sexual relationships (AOR = 2.0, p = 0.002), and more likely to worry about acquiring HIV(AOR = 1.5, p = 0.04). There was an association between having a greater dissatisfaction with one's body image and never using condoms during sexual intercourse in the past 30 days (AOR = 1.6, p = 0.04) and more likely to engage in unprotected vaginal sex in the prior 6 months (AOR = 1.6, p = 0.04). Prior research has demonstrated an association between African American women's body image and greater obesity risk, lower self-esteem, and greater depression. The present study has shown an association between body image dissatisfaction and a range of sexual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Women who are more dissatisfied with their body image may be at greater risk for unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV infection.}

Irrespective of its level of intensity, training has not proved to be associated with manifest risk. Moderate training seems to be beneficial, by increasing the peripheral effect of insulin among those possibly at risk of gestational diabetes. Gravidae who train not only tend to be characterised by better health and self-esteem, and a lower incidence of depression during pregnancy, but also find delivery less strenuous. The offspring of women who train during pregnancy manifest fewer signs of stress during delivery, and are usually characterised by better general condition (e.g., higher Apgar scores).}

Coping resources and depressive symptomatology were assessed at Time 1, stress and coping were assessed at Time 2, and depressive symptomatology and partner ratings of coping effectiveness were assessed at Times 2 and 3. After control of the effects of initial depression, there was evidence of significant effects of levels of stress and coping responses on the Time 2 and Time 3 outcome measures. There were also some evidence linking coping resources (particularly self-esteem and family support) to postpartum depressive symptomatology.}

  abstract = {A substantial body of objective data now exists to support the consensus view that induced abortion results in a low incidence of psychiatric morbidity. However, these data do not include more recent advances in abortion technology. Medical abortion entails a participatory role on the part of the woman, who may perceive more pain or see products of conception. The physical and psychological events experienced by women undergoing this procedure may lead to differences in psychopathology. 363 women undergoing legal induced abortion up to 63 days gestation were allocated by a prospective partially randomised design to undergo medical abortion (using mifepristone 600 mg followed 48 h later by gemeprost 1 mg vaginal pessary) or vacuum aspiration performed under general anesthesia. This study design allowed women with a preference for a particular method to undergo that method; women without preferences were allocated at random. Women completed sensitive and reliable psychometric instruments (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a semantic differential rating scale designed to measure self-esteem) prior to abortion and 16 days later. There were no significant differences between women allocated at random to medical abortion or vacuum aspiration in post-abortal anxiety, depression or low self-esteem. Women with high levels of mood disturbance prior to abortion, who were smokers or who had medical complications following abortion were at highest risk of post-abortal mood disorder. Medical abortion is a psychologically safe as surgical vacuum aspiration. The quantitative findings of the study support the consensus view that abortion is associated with high incidence of psychological benefit, whichever method is used.}

The obstetrician-gynecologist should be aware of factors that contribute to the high prevalence of depression in women, and particular attention should be given to family and work roles, victimization, early childhood loss of parent, personality variables, and reproductive-related events such as pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. It is also important to distinguish between a grief reaction and major depression. Grief occurs secondary to losses such as abortion, miscarriage, still-birth, or infertility and is generally self-limiting; self-esteem is preserved. In major depression, changes in sleeping patterns, appetite, energy, and mood persist, along with loss of self-esteem. As a part of patient education, it should be emphasized that depression is a medical illness and not a character defect or weakness and that in most cases it can be treated effectively. However, the risk of recurrence is significant; patients should be alert to early signs and symptoms of recurrence and seek treatment. Antidepressants that are well tolerated are now available, and appropriate use of these medications, along with psychotherapy as needed, will provide effective treatment for most patients.}

There is little evidence, however, linking maternal smoking and increased rates of children's behavior problems. Data from the population-based National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were used to investigate the possible association of maternal smoking and behavior problems among 2256 children aged 4 through 11 years. In multiple regression analyses the authors controlled for child's race, age, sex, birth weight, and chronic asthma; family structure, income, and divorce or separation in the prior 2 years; mother's education, intelligence, self-esteem, employment status, chronic disabling health conditions, and use of alcohol during pregnancy; and the quality of the home environment as assessed by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form to investigate the relationship between maternal smoking and children's behavior problems. The measure of maternal smoking status reflected two levels of smoking intensity (less than a pack per day and a pack or more per day) for each of three different categories of children's exposure: prenatal only (mother smoked only during pregnancy), passive only (mother smoked only after pregnancy), and prenatal plus passive exposure (mother smoked both during and after pregnancy). Measures of children's behavior problems included the overall score on a 32-item parent-reported child Behavior Problem Index (PBI), scores on the BPI's subscales, and rates of extreme scores on the BPI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)}
