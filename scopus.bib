  abstract = {Background: Postpartum mood disorders range in severity from the early maternity blues to postpartum psychosis, a serious state affecting less than 1\% of mothers. An estimated 10-15\% of new mothers are affected by mild postnatal depression, usually manifesting within the first three months after birth. The strongest antenatal predictors of postnatal depression are depression during pregnancy, anxiety during pregnancy, stressful recent life events, lack of social support, a previous history of depression, and low self-esteem. Aims: To study the prevalence and severity of postnatal depression. Methods: Semi-structured socio-demographic and clinical data sheet was used to record the particulars of the patients. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS) was used for the screening purpose, later the clinical diagnosis is established as per the 'International Classification of Diseases Research and Diagnostic Criteria'. Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) was used to assess the severity of depressive episode. The findings were analysed using SPSS-16. Results: The prevalence of depression in the current study is sixty percent. The mean age of the population is 26.5 {$\pm$}5.09 years. Most women in the present sample were primipara. Constitution of domestic violence to the severity of depression is found to be significant. Conclusion: Significant depression levels were found in younger age group and in population with a family income of less than 10,000 rupees per month. Depression was significantly more prevalent in those with marital duration less than five years and those who are primigravida. Most of the mothers having female child were depressed which is incommensurable with those who gave birth to male child.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Literature concerning paternal postpartum depression (PPPD) is rare. However, PPPD is a highly relevant disorder and can have a detrimental effect on the well-being of the family. Paternal care is an essential factor for infants' mental development, and PPPD has been clearly shown to influence infants' psychopathology and behavior later in life. This preliminary study aimed to detect the prevalence of PPPD and the correlated demographic and socioeconomic factors in fathers to newborns at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted at KAUH in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between January 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018. We collected data telephonically through questionnaires based on previous studies. A PPPD cutoff score of \textquestiondown 10 using a validated Arabic translation of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used. We enrolled 150 fathers with a mean age of 36.61{$\pm$}7.72 years in the study. Results The results showed that more than a quarter (27.3\%) of the participants suffered from PPPD. Factors that correlate with PPPD included a weak relationship with the partner/mother (p=0.001), trouble sleeping (p=0.010), lower self-esteem (p=0.012), family-related problems (p \textexclamdown 0.0001), work-related problems (p=0.002), work\textendash family conflict (p\textexclamdown 0.0001), and perceived perinatal and postpartum stress (p=0.001 and \textexclamdown 0.0001 respectively). Conclusions The results confirm that PPPD is prevalent among fathers in Jeddah. Screening for and treatment of PPPD in Saudi Arabia is currently lacking, and the prevalence of PPPD according to these findings indicates that these deficiencies urgently need to be addressed. Counselling and support for managing health, family, and work issues during and after pregnancy could contribute to preventing PPPD. \textcopyright{} 2020 Alghamdi et al.},

Perineal massage has spread as a prophylactic technique for treating complications during labor. Acknowledged effects of perineal massage are reduction of incidence and severity of perineal tear and use of equipment directly related to the intrapartum perineal trauma. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of massage in urinary incontinence prevention and identification of possible differences in its form of application (self-massage or by a physiotherapist), with the previous assumption that it is effective and that there are differences between the different forms of application. Materials and Methods: A controlled clinical trial with a sample of 81 pregnant women was conducted. The participants were divided into three groups: a group that received the massage applied by a specialized physiotherapist, another group that applied the massage to themselves, and a control group that only received ordinary obstetric care. Results: No differences were identified in the incidence or severity of urinary incontinence among the three groups. The severity of the incontinence was only affected by the body mass index and the weight of the baby at the time of delivery. Conclusions: A relationship between perineal massage interventions and development of urinary incontinence has not been observed. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.},

Although not much research comparing the emotional distress following medical and surgical abortion is available, few studies have compared psychological sequelae following both methods of abortion early in the first trimester of pregnancy. The aim of this review was to assess the psychological sequelae and emotional distress following medical and surgical abortion at 10-13 weeks gestation. Methods. Partially randomized patient preference trial in a Scottish Teaching Hospital was conducted. The hospital anxiety and depression scales were used to assess emotional distress. Anxiety levels were also assessed using visual analog scales while semantic differential rating scales were used to measure self-esteem. A total of 368 women were randomized, while 77 entered the preference cohort. Results. There were no significant differences in hospital anxiety and depression scales scores for anxiety or depression between the groups. Visual analog scales showed higher anxiety levels in women randomized to surgery prior to abortion (P \textexclamdown{} 0.0001), while women randomized to surgical treatment were less anxious after abortion (P \textexclamdown{} 0.0001). Semantic differential rating scores showed a fall in self-esteem in the randomized medical group compared to those undergoing surgery (P = 0.02). Conclusions. Medical abortion at 10-13 weeks is effective and does not increase psychological morbidity compared to surgical vacuum aspiration and hence should be made available to all women undergoing abortion at these gestations. \textcopyright{} Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 2005.},

  abstract = {Of the couples trying to conceive (had frequent, unprotected sexual intercourse for a year or longer) 15\% will experience infertility with the annual incidence of infertility estimated at 1.2 couples per 1,000 total in the general population. Male factors contribute to over 50\% of the cases with 7\% of the male population experiencing infertility. Not being able to conceive a child is emotionally traumatic and frustrating and can affect the person's self esteem and the couple's relationship. Major progress has been achieved in identifying the etiology of male infertility and especially the genetic causes. However, in about 40\% of the male infertility cases, the etiology remains unknown and both the diagnosis and/or treatment are a challenge. Genetic testing to determine the underlying genetic cause of infertility is not 100\% and genes involved are still being discovered. Consequently, negative genetic test results do not rule out a genetic cause. Thus, genetic counselling should include information regarding the genetic etiology, if known, and the treatment options available. Furthermore, when the infertile couple/male is seeking assisted reproductive technology (ART) using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), genetic counselling should include information regarding the risk of transmitting the genetic disorder, causing the male infertility, to the offspring. Therefore, the provision of genetic counselling is an integral component in the investigation and treatment of male infertility. This article will discuss the genetic counselling approach in cases with male infertility. \textcopyright{} Translational Andrology and Urology. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Although several systematic reviews have addressed the antecedents and consequences of adolescent motherhood, none have examined adolescent fatherhood. Objectives: The aims of this systematic review were to identify evidence-based factors that increase the probability of adolescent fatherhood and to identify outcomes that differ between adolescent fathers compared to two other groups, namely adult fathers and non-father age peers. The current study used a theoretical framework, Parke's systems view, to guide the review. Method: The search strategy included a bibliographic search of PubMed and PsycINFO. To be included, publications had to be (a)peer-reviewed, (b)quantitative studies, (c)published in English, and (d)compare adolescent fathers (\textexclamdown 20 years)to adult fathers (\textquestiondown 19 years)or to non-father peers (13- to 19-years old). Results: A total of 2869 unique published sources were screened and 39 met these inclusion criteria. More than half of the articles focused on antecedents (k = 24), with the most consistent evidence showing that adolescent fathers come from disadvantaged backgrounds characterized by single-parent households and low parental socioeconomic status. There is also evidence that adolescent fathers were disproportionately Black or Latino (vs. White), had lower academic competence, engaged in more delinquent behavior (e.g., vandalism), and had peers who engaged in more anti-social behaviors. Articles on the outcomes of adolescent fatherhood (k = 23)yielded consistent evidence that their offspring are at greater risk of being preterm or low birthweight and psychological disorders as compared to the offspring of adult fathers. Conclusions: Much of the literature was published prior to the year 2000, and methodological weaknesses are noted. Nonetheless, this review has implications for beginning to establish an evidence-based understanding of adolescent fathers. Future rigorous and theory-driven research can provide an even clearer picture and a basis for intervention. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Objective: To investigate the prevalence of major depression in twin pregnancies and correlate with stress and social support. Method: The study included 51 pregnant women under specialized prenatal care who were evaluated by a Portuguese version of the semi-structured questionnaire Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) for Major Depression, and the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile (PPP) for evaluation of stress and social support. Results: Major depression was found in 33.3\% of pregnant women, and prevailing symptoms were fatigue or loss of energy (100\%), insomnia or hypersomnia (82.4\%), changes in appetite (82.4\%), decreased interest in daily activities (82.4\%), and psychomotor agitation or retardation (82.4\%). Among pregnant women who were diagnosed depressive, 76.5\% also had a high level of stress and 47.1\% complained about lack of social support. Statistical significance was found when correlating depression with perception of negative aspects of having twins and belief in significant body changes during pregnancy (p =.005 and.03, respectively). Marital status, occupation, and pregnancy planning were not significantly associated with the diagnosis of depression. Conclusion: Major depression occurs in one-third of pregnant women expecting twins and is associated with higher levels of stress and lack of social support. A multidisciplinary approach in these cases is fundamental to minimize further risks and complications. \textcopyright{} The Authors 2013.},

Adolescents often display an approach to sexuality and a perception of risk-behavior completely different from adults. For these reasons, contraceptive education and counselling require specific competences. Contextual factors, related to family situations, body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem, peer pressure, internet dependency, experiencing an asymmetric relationship, have a significant impact on protective choice and contraceptive adherence and compliance. Furthermore, we have to consider that adolescents are still in a growing trajectory, also from a biological point of view. Therefore, we propose also a revision of the impact of various contraceptive methods on cervico-vaginal milieu, on the function of hypothalamus-pituitary- ovarian axis, on bone mineral content increase and on mood disorders. The clinical history of our young patients should focus, with empathy, both on social and emotional situations and changes, on the need of information, and on physical maturation, together with the well-known biological risk factors, in order to direct a proper protective choice. \textcopyright{} 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {Urinary incontinence affects millions of people in the UK to varying degrees. Prevalence is likely to be significantly underestimated because patients are reluctant to seek medical help, for fear of embarrassment or belief that little can be done to improve matters. As a result, incontinence has remained a 'hidden' condition, even though it impacts heavily on patients' quality of life and can lead to low self-esteem, depression and withdrawal from society. Although any age group can be affected, urinary incontinence is primarily a disorder of advancing age; however, it should not be dismissed as an unavoidable consequence of the ageing process. Reduced mobility and increased dependence on carers amongst the elderly can worsen the physical and psychological impact of the condition. The management of urinary incontinence usually involves a combination of behavioural and pharmacological interventions. Bladder retraining and pelvic floor exercises can bring about gradual improvement of symptoms, though both techniques demand motivation and commitment from the patient. Antimuscarinic agents (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium, solifenacin and propiverine) represent the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for urge incontinence, though tolerability, particularly dry mouth, is a recognised problem with these drugs.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite improvements in maternity healthcare services over the last few decades, more than 2.7 million babies worldwide are stillborn each year. The global health agenda is silent about stillbirth, perhaps, in part, because its wider impact has not been systematically analysed or understood before now across the world. Our study aimed to systematically review, evaluate and summarise the current evidence regarding the psychosocial impact of stillbirth to parents and their families, with the aim of improving guidance in bereavement care worldwide. Methods: Systematic review and meta-summary (quantitative aggregation of qualitative findings) of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. All languages and countries were included. Results: Two thousand, six hundred and nineteen abstracts were identified; 144 studies were included. Frequency effect sizes (FES \%) were calculated for each theme, as a measure of their prevalence in the literature. Themes ranged from negative psychological symptoms post bereavement (77 {$\cdot$} 1) and in subsequent pregnancies (27 {$\cdot$} 1), to disenfranchised grief (31 {$\cdot$} 2), and incongruent grief (28 {$\cdot$} 5), There was also impact on siblings (23 {$\cdot$} 6) and on the wider family (2 {$\cdot$} 8). They included mixed-feelings about decisions made when the baby died (12 {$\cdot$} 5), avoidance of memories (13 {$\cdot$} 2), anxiety over other children (7 {$\cdot$} 6), chronic pain and fatigue (6 {$\cdot$} 9), and a different approach to the use of healthcare services (6 {$\cdot$} 9). Some themes were particularly prominent in studies of fathers; grief suppression (avoidance)(18 {$\cdot$} 1), employment difficulties, financial debt (5 {$\cdot$} 6), and increased substance use (4 {$\cdot$} 2). Others found in studies specific to mothers included altered body image (3 {$\cdot$} 5) and impact on quality of life (2 {$\cdot$} 1). Counter-intuitively, Some themes had mixed connotations. These included parental pride in the baby (5 {$\cdot$} 6), motivation for engagement in healthcare improvement (4 {$\cdot$} 2) and changed approaches to life and death, self-esteem, and own identity (25 {$\cdot$} 7). In studies from low/middle income countries, stigmatisation (13 {$\cdot$} 2) and pressure to prioritise or delay conception (9) were especially prevalent. Conclusion: Experiencing the birth of a stillborn child is a life-changing event. The focus of the consequences may vary with parent gender and country. Stillbirth can have devastating psychological, physical and social costs, with ongoing effects on interpersonal relationships and subsequently born children. However, parents who experience the tragedy of stillbirth can develop resilience and new life-skills and capacities. Future research should focus on developing interventions that may reduce the psychosocial cost of stillbirth. \textcopyright{} 2016 Burden et al.},

We hypothesized that women with an asthma diagnosis would have poorer biobehavioral health risk factors and pregnancy outcomes compared to women without an asthma diagnosis. The Central Pennsylvania Women's Health Study (CePAWHS) included a population-based survey examining health status indicators, risk factors and outcomes, and detailed pregnancy histories among 2,002 women (ages 18-45). 213 asthmatics were identified. Compared with Non-asthmatic women (NA), Asthmatic (A) women reported lower rates of excellent health status (45\% A vs. 65\% NA, P\textexclamdown 0.001), were more likely to be overweight or obese (68\% A vs. 50\% NA, P\textexclamdown 0.001), and were more likely to have smoked cigarettes during their first pregnancy (25\% A vs. 17\% NA, P\textexclamdown 0.01). Psychological measures (psychosocial hassles, low self-esteem, depression) were reported more often in asthmatics than non-asthmatics. Also, asthmatics reported a higher incidence of gestational diabetes (10\% A vs. 6\% of NA, P = 0.05), preterm births (25\% A vs. 16\% NA, P\textexclamdown 0.01), and had a higher proportion of low birth weight infants (20\% A vs. 13\% NA, P = 0.03) compared with non-asthmatics. As predicted, asthmatics had poorer biobehavioral risk factors and outcomes compared to non-asthmatics. These findings illustrate the need to target asthmatic women of reproductive age, particularly in this largely rural setting, with interventions to reduce biobehavioral risk factors as part of a strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

A case-control study was performed with 85 pregnant women (45 adolescents and 40 adults) who attended a prenatal care course at a teaching hospital in Mexico City. During the second and third trimesters of gestation, a test proposed by Zung was applied to measure depressive symptoms. Weight and skinfolds (i.e., triceps, biceps, suprailiac, subscapular, and thigh) were measured in all women beginning at week 20 of gestation through 4 weeks postpartum. Monthly evaluations were performed. Results. At the 28th week of gestation, nearly 40\% of pregnant adolescents showed scores above the cut-off points in the depression test, while among the adults this proportion corresponded to 15\%. In the adolescents, depression status was related to self-esteem. Percentage of body fat in adult women tended to be relatively constant, while in adolescents a tendency toward increased body fat was found. In adolescents, depressive symptomatology and especially lack of self-esteem and weight gain during pregnancy were the variables that better predicted the fat-increment pattern during gestation, while in adults no variable was found that predicted fat deposition. Conclusions. Depression status is a risk factor for excessive fat deposition during pregnancy in Mexican adolescents. Copyright (C) 2000 IMSS.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with antepartum depression among Thai women. Materials and Methods: All pregnant women attending the Antenatal Care Clinic at Songklanagarind Hospital from June to August 2020 were invited to participate and evaluated through self-administered questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for the data analysis in order to control for potential confounders. Results: 435 women were in their first, second, and third trimester of pregnancy (20.2 \%, 39.5 \%, and 40.2 \%, respectively). The majority of them reported normal Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale scores (83.4 \%) and a high level of perceived social support (74.5 \%). Moreover, according to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores, the prevalence of antepartum depression was 10.6 \%. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that factors associated with antepartum depression were second trimester of pregnancy, survival and below-survival levels of income, unintended pregnancy, and low level of self-esteem. Conclusion: One-tenth of pregnant Thai women suffered from depression. Advanced gestational age, low income, unintended pregnancy, and low self-esteem were significant factors associated with antepartum depression. \textcopyright{} 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract = {This chapter will focus on two genetic syndromes affecting gonadotropin function that typically present in childhood, Klinefelter syndrome, and testotoxicosis. Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy with a prevalence of 1 in 450-500 male births. Unless detected by prenatal screening or prenatal diagnosis, this chromosome variation diagnosis is frequently missed in children. Physical, neurocognitive, and psychosocial phenotypes of boys with 47, XXY are extremely variable, making a typical case difficult to characterize. Health care needs of boys born with 47, XXY are complex including the need for monitoring growth, pubertal development, optimization of reproductive capacity, bone health, and acknowledgement of physical symptoms such as fatigue, hypotonic muscle strength, tremors, tics, and pain. Physical health risks associated with 47, XXY include: metabolic syndrome, Type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, immunological issues, bone loss, and certain types of malignancies. Boys with 47, XXY frequently show executive function issues, language-based learning difficulties, problems with communication, and struggles with behavior that contribute to stressors for the boys as well as for their families. Psychosocial manifestations of these stressors include low self-esteem, increased risk for depression, difficulties maintaining personal relationships, and adverse quality of life. There is a general lack of awareness in the health care community about the complexities of care required for families who have sons with 47, XXY. Since puberty is a sentinel time for diagnosing and monitoring hypogonadism, families often depend on professionals in the specialty of endocrinology to address their many concerns. Families seeking anticipatory guidance about how 47, XXY will influence the growth and development of their sons often look to the specialty of endocrinology to help them navigate a health care environment that is confusing to them. This chapter will describe the physical, neurocognitive, and psychosocial phenotype of 47, XXY in childhood and provide suggestions for endocrine-related health surveillance for advanced practice nurses (APRN). APRNs in endocrinology practice are perfectly positioned to assess, coordinate, and provide family-centered navigation for health surveillance according to child's level of development. Testotoxicosis or familial male-limited precocious puberty is a rare dominant form of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty caused by constitutively activating mutations of the luteinizing hormone receptor. Affected males present premature and progressive virilization associated with accelerated growth and advanced bone age between 2 and 4 years of age. Hormonal profile is characterized by elevated testosterone levels, despite prepubertal levels of luteinizing hormone. Treatment typically consists of reducing hyperandrogenism with ketoconazole or a combination of antiandrogens and aromatase inhibitors. \textcopyright{} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

Patients and Methods: Subjects were participants enrolled in a parenting program that provided comprehensive multidisciplinary medical care to teen mothers and their children. Baseline data of a prospective cohort study were collected by interview at 2 weeks postpartum and follow-up, and standardized measures on entry into postnatal parenting groups. Demographic data included education, social supports, psychological history, family history and adverse life events. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children short version (CES-DC). The Maternal Self-report Inventory (MSRI) measured perceived maternal self-esteem, and Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire measured social support. Data were analyzed with bivariate analyses and linear regression modeling focusing on depressive symptoms as the outcome variable. Results: In the 168 teen mothers, mean age 17.6 {$\pm$} 1.2 years, African American (50\%), Latina (31\%) or Biracial (13\%), the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 53.6\%. In the linear model, controlling for baby's age, teen's age, ethnicity, Temporary Aid for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC), and previous suicidal gesture, increased depressive symptoms were associated with decreased perceived maternal caretaking ability (P = 0.003) and lower social support (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). In a linear model controlling for the same variables, MSRI total score (P = 0.001) and social support (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) contributed significantly to the model as did the interaction term (MSRI \texttimes{} Social Support, P = 0.044). Conclusions: Depression is associated with decreased maternal confidence in their ability to parent and decreased perceived maternal social support, with a possible moderating effect of social support on the relationship of maternal self-esteem and depression. \textcopyright{} 2008 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.},

Main outcome measures: Mothers' Information Tool, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Index of Breastfeeding Status. Results: 110 (89.4\%) of the sample initiated breastfeeding or initiated a milk supply by pumping. Percentage of breast milk feedings at time 2 predicted whether or not a woman was still breastfeeding at time 3 (odds ratio = 3.63, p \textexclamdown{} .001). Conclusion: A high percentage of breastfeeding initiation was found despite the increased care burden that has been described for mothers of twins. Mothers who continued to breastfeed at time 3 provided a high percentage of the twins' milk feedings as breast milk. The results suggest that mothers who are able to persist with the difficulties of establishing a milk supply for twins and feeding two infants are able to continue providing a high percentage of the infants' feedings as breast milk.},

Methods In a population-based cohort in a health region near Vancouver, Canada, 522 mothers completed a mailed questionnaire at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum measuring socio-demographic, biological, pregnancy-related, life stressor, social support, obstetric, and maternal adjustment factors. We undertook a sequential logistic regression analysis to develop a multifactorial predictive model of sustained postpartum anxiety, as measured by a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score \textquestiondown 40 at 1 week and/or 4 weeks, and 8 weeks postpartum. Results The prevalence of sustained postpartum anxiety was 12.6\% (95\% CI 9.6\textendash 16.2). In the multivariable model, predictors of sustained anxiety in the postpartum period were perceived stress at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 3.74, 95\% CI 2.17-6.44) and partner social support at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.40\textendash 0.85). Depression symptomatology at 1 week, child care stress, and maternal self-esteem were non-significant. Limitations Single women and women from ethnic minority backgrounds were underrepresented in the sample. Conclusions A large proportion of women experience sustained postpartum anxiety. High perceived stress and low partner social support can be used to facilitate early identification of women likely to experience persistent anxiety in the postpartum period and suggest the need for urgent access to psychotherapeutic services for these women. These factors may also be potential targets for individual or couples therapy to treat postpartum anxiety. \textcopyright{} 2017},

  abstract = {Pregnancy is a very complex and highly stressful time in which women become more physically and emotionally vulnerable. Therefore, mothers are more likely to face decreased self-esteem and increased postpartum depression. Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, more than 50 \% of mothers are undiagnosed or untreated, showing an urgent need to explore an effective preventive strategy. A healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity have been suggested to be associated with an increased quality of life in pregnant and postpartum women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether swimming exercise before and during pregnancy can affect maternal care and postpartum depression-related behaviors in dams. To this end, female NMRI and C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to swimming exercise before conception and throughout pregnancy. On postpartum days 1\textendash 2, maternal behavior including nest building, active nursing, and licking/grooming were monitored. A battery of behavioral tests was also used to measure depression-related symptoms including anhedonia- and anxiety-like behavior, social behavior, and behavioral despair. To identify the underlying mechanisms, corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines during late pregnancy, and corticosterone and brain serotonin during the postpartum period were measured in dams. The findings indicated that swimming exercise increased gestational corticosterone, decreased maternal care and brain serotonin, and increased all depression-related behaviors in postpartum C57BL/6 J dams, while only increased licking/grooming and social behavior, and reduced anhedonia-like behavior in postpartum NMRI dams. Taken together, this study suggests that swimming exercise before and during pregnancy could alter maternal care and postpartum depression-like behavior in a strain-dependent manner. \textcopyright{} 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

The aim of this study is to investigate and determine significant risk factors associated with the development of postnatal depressive symptomatology at 6-8 weeks after childbirth in a sample of Italian women. DESIGN: retrospective study on risk factors related to the development of postnatal depressive symptomatology at 6-8 weeks after childbirth. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study was conducted in the Southern Area of the Local Health Unit of Modena: 300 women who gave birth in Pavullo in the Frignano's Hospital or in Sassuolo's Hospital from 13.12.2009 to 3.2.2010 were considered. METHODS: four weeks after delivery, women had to complete the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised (PDPI-R) to detect the presence of specific risk factors. Then a double-test strategy, including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the General Health Questionnaire 12 items (GHQ12) at 6-8 weeks after childbirth, was used. The women who scored values above the cut-off in both tests have been considered to have high depressive symptomatology. RESULTS: risk factors associated with postnatal depressive symptomatology were: low self-esteem, prenatal anxiety, prior depression, child care stress and baby blues (p \textexclamdown 0.01), prenatal depression, lack of social support from partner and difficult infant temperament (p \textexclamdown 0.05). CONCLUSION: 14.3\% of the women considered showed high depressive symptomatology at 6-8 weeks after delivery (according to the prevalence rates of postpartum depression in Western Countries). Furthermore, the results (risk factors) mainly confirmed the evidence of the international literature.},

Methods: Record linkage of routinely collected Scotland-wide administrative databases covering prescriptions [prescribing information system (PIS)], hospitalizations (Scottish Morbidity Records 01 and 04), maternity records (Scottish Morbidity Records 02), deaths (National Records of Scotland), annual pupil census, school absences/exclusions, special educational needs (Scottish Exchange of Educational Data; ScotXed), examinations (Scottish Qualifications Authority) and (un)employment (ScotXed) provided data on 766 237 children attending Scottish schools between 2009 and 2013 inclusively. We compared educational and health outcomes of children receiving antidepressant medication with their peers, adjusting for confounders (socio-demographic, maternity and comorbidity) and explored effect modifiers and mediators. Results: Compared with peers, children receiving antidepressants were more likely to be absent [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.90, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.85-1.95] or excluded (adjusted IRR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.29-1.69) from school, have special educational needs [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.77, 95\% CI 1.65-1.90], have the lowest level of academic attainment (adjusted OR 3.00, 95\% CI 2.51-3.58) and be unemployed after leaving school (adjusted OR 1.88, 95\% CI 1.71-2.08). They had increased hospitalization [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.07, 95\% CI 1.98-2.18] and mortality (adjusted HR 2.73, 95\% CI 1.73-4.29) over 5 years' follow-up. Higher absenteeism partially explained poorer attainment and unemployment. Treatment with antidepressants was less common among boys than girls (0.5\% vs 1.0\%) but the associations with special educational need and unemployment were stronger in boys. Conclusions: Children receiving antidepressants fare worse than their peers across a wide range of education and health outcomes. Interventions to reduce absenteeism or mitigate its effects should be investigated. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.},

Results: Forty-seven percent of expectant mothers scored at or above the widely accepted clinical cutoff score of 16 on the CES-D; 30\% scored at or above 20, a score more likely to reflect elevated depressive symptoms among adolescents; and almost 20\% scored at or above 28 (one standard deviation above the mean), a score suggestive of clinical depression. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with less use of public assistance, external locus of control, less social support, and lower self-esteem. Conclusions: Data suggest that a large proportion of pregnant AI adolescents reported elevated depressive symptoms, though rates are similar to non-pregnant AI adolescent samples. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.},

  abstract = {The four psychiatric complications that can occur following delivery are posttraumatic stress disorder (incidence 1\%), baby blues (80\%), postnatal psychosis (0.2\%), and postnatal depression (20\%). A strategy for preventing postnatal depression is outlined in this article. Risk factors should be identified during prenatal visits. The causes of postnatal depression fall into three main categories: hormonal factors interpersonal factors, and intrapsychic factors. Emphasis is put on the fact that pregnancy is an upheaval comparable in magnitude to adolescence. Low self-esteem is the basis of the depressive process. The multiple consequences of postnatal depression, including child abuse, are described. Use of relaxation techniques during the prenatal period should be encouraged. Administration of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or of Zerssen's scale on the third postnatal day is useful for evaluating the severity of the baby blues that antedate postnatal depression by four to six months. Routine use of these scales would allow early identification and management of women at high risk for developing this dangerously underestimated disorder.},

Despite this epidemiology and what is known about the importance of paternal mental health to family functioning, there is limited research on evidence-based interventions for PPD. This systematic review aimed to investigate the literature for randomized-controlled trials (RCT) of interventions for PPD. Methods: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Search terms included depression, depressive disorder, fathers, pregnancy, and peripartum period, etc. Results: The search strategy identified 2949 items. A total of 10 interventions over the course of 25 years of research met inclusion criteria. Three of the included studies found a small but significant effect on paternal depression scores. However, none of the included studies exclusively targeted paternal mental health. Instead, they addressed paternal well-being indirectly by focusing on the mother, infant, or couple relationship. Limitations: Studies did not require fathers to meet criteria for depression at baseline. This may have resulted in a selection bias, whereby the included fathers may not have required any treatment. We were also unable to perform additional statistical analyses because of the limited research available as well as the inconsistent outcome measures. Conclusions: There remains limited research on interventions assessing paternal depressive symptomatology, and none have targeted diagnosed PPD. Because of the prevalence and impact of this disorder, it is imperative to identify and offer treatments and interventions specifically tailored towards this population. \textcopyright{} 2019},

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study on 150 women (with a 100\% response rate) hospitalized for ectopic pregnancy et al.-Zahra hospital in Tabriz, Iran, during 2018\textendash 2019, and recruited via convenience sampling. Data were collected using the General Health Questionnaire-28, which has four subscales (overall score range: 0 to 84; subscale score range: 0 to 21 with a lower score indicating a better mental state), and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (score range: - 10 to + 10 with a higher score indicating higher self-esteem). To determine the association between self-esteem and mental health, independent t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression were used. Results: The response rate was 100\%. The mean score (SD) of participants' mental health was 31.4 (8.5), and that of self-esteem was 4.5 (3.80). The percentage of participants who were considered as having mental distress (i.e., overall GHQ-28 score {$\geq$} 24) was 76\%. Among the subscales of mental health, social dysfunction was the most prevalent (observed in 100\% of the participants), followed by somatic symptoms (79.3\%). Lower self-esteem was significantly associated with overall mental distress (odds ratio (OR): 0.74; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 0.64\textendash 0.87; P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), depression (OR: 0.70; 95\% CI: 0.60\textendash 0.80; P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) and anxiety/insomnia (OR: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.66\textendash 0.87; P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Discussion: Mental distress was common among women with ectopic pregnancy. This study is the first to examine the relationship between self-esteem and mental health among women with ectopic pregnancy and highlights the important role of self-esteem in mental wellbeing among those women. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Background. A substantial body of objective data now exists to support the consensus view that induced abortion results in a low incidence of psychiatric morbidity. However, these data do not include more recent advances in abortion technology. Medical abortion entails a participatory role on the part of the woman, who may perceive more pain or see products of conception. The physical and psychological events experienced by women undergoing this procedure may lead to differences in psychopathology. Methods. 363 women undergoing legal induced abortion up to 63 days gestation were allocated by a prospective partially randomised design to undergo medical abortion (using mifepristone 600 mg followed 48 h later by gemeprost 1 mg vaginal pessary) or vacuum aspiration performed under general anesthesia. This study design allowed women with a preference for a particular method to undergo that method; women without preferences were allocated at random. Women completed sensitive and reliable psychometric instruments (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a semantic differential rating scale designed to measure self-esteem) prior to abortion and 16 days later. Results. There were no significant differences between women allocated at random to medical abortion or vacuum aspiration in post-abortal anxiety, depression or low self-esteem. Women with high levels of mood disturbance prior to abortion, who were smokers or who had medical complications following abortion were at highest risk of post-abortal mood disorder. Conclusions. Medical abortion is as psychologically safe as surgical vacuum aspiration. The quantitative findings of the study support the consensus view that abortion is associated with high incidence of psychological benefit, whichever method is used. 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted},

The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of symptoms of PMADS among Black women. Methods: Black women completed a paper survey between August 2019 and October 2019. Binomial logistic regression was employed to examine predictors of PMAD symptoms. Results: The prevalence of symptoms of PMADs was 56\%. A higher proportion of women with PMADs had experienced depression (16\% vs. 32\%, p = 0.006); physical (18\% vs. 31\%, p = 0.030), emotional (35\% vs. 61\%, p = 0.000), or sexual abuse (12\% vs. 29\%, p = 0.002); and symptoms of depression or anxiety before pregnancy (18\% vs. 46\%, p = 0.000). After adjusting for socio-demographics in multivariate analysis, experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety before pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.445, p = 0.001) was positively associated with experiencing symptoms of PMADs, whereas higher levels of self-esteem (aOR = 0.837, p = 0.000) were negatively associated with experiencing symptoms of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Conclusions for Practice: The prevalence of PMAD symptoms among this sample of Black women was alarmingly high. Women who experienced PMADs were more likely to report adverse childhood experiences (e.g., physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse). By understanding the prevalence of PMADs and the factors associated with these disorders, healthcare professionals can improve diagnosis and treatment rates among this understudied and underserved population. \textcopyright{} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {Foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a growing concern in South Africa. In the Western Cape, prevalence rates for FAS are the highest in the world. Not surprisingly, the Western Cape also has some of the highest levels of alcohol consumption per capita. Although FAS is primarily caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy, the high rate of FAS in South Africa originates from a multitude of complex factors. These factors include heritage, poverty, high levels of unemployment and low-paid menial jobs, depression, low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, increased accessibility to alcohol, lack of recreation, poor education, familial pressure, denial, cultural misconceptions and the smaller physiques of some of the women in the Western Cape. Holistic and comprehensive macro- and micro-level approaches are necessary in order to change the alcohol consumption trend that has developed over the last 300 years. No single strategy will reduce or eliminate the burden of alcohol misuse in this society. However, as the presented discussion suggests, combining the spirit of motivational interviewing (MI) with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) practice, borrowed from health psychological interventions for lifestyle-related chronic health conditions, holds promise for reducing the prevalence of FAS within Western Cape communities. These individual-based approaches have yet to be employed in South Africa despite the wealth of evidence that demonstrates their potential in targeting high-risk groups and reducing per capita alcohol consumption. \textcopyright{} SAAFP.},

Twenty-seven percent of the women reported depressive symptoms at levels indicating risk for clinical depression.

Psychosocial and behavioral risk factors accounted for an additional 19\% of the BDI-II variance (P \textexclamdown{} .001), and psychosocial and spiritual resources accounted for 7\% of the variance (P \textexclamdown{} .001), resulting in these variables accounting for 54\% of the total variance in BDI-II scores. Higher levels of stress, lower levels of self-esteem and social support, and higher religiosity had a significant relationship with more symptoms of depression. This supports the need to routinely screen for and to assess factors associated with depressive symptoms in pregnant low-income women. \textcopyright{} 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

Objective: To examine the prevalence of depressive symptoms in pregnancy and examine the biopsychosocial-spiritual risks and resources in low-income women of diverse racial/ethnic groups. Methods: Prenatal interviews were conducted at 16-28 weeks gestation with 324 pregnant women from rural prenatal clinics in the southeastern United States; 43\% were African American, 31\% were Caucasian, and 26\% were Hispanic. Multivariate logistic regression tested the contributions of psychosocial risks and psychosocial and spiritual resources to risk for depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II scores \^g\textperthousand\textyen 16) for the aggregate and for each racial-ethnic group. Results: Beck Depression Inventory-II scores indicating risk for depression were found in 33\% of the women. There were no significant differences in symptom rates among African Americans, Caucasians, and Hispanics (37\%, 25\%, and 36\%, respectively). African American race, abuse, more stress, less social support, less self-esteem, and less spirituality were associated with risk for depression, controlling for sociodemographic factors. Discussion: A third of this diverse group of rural low-income women were at risk for depression in pregnancy.

The risk factors for PPD include both individual factors and joint couple/dyadic factors, and both should be addressed by prevention programs. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a dyadic PPD prevention program that targets both individual and couple/dyadic factors. The 5-week, online PPD prevention program included 18 couples (n=36, i.e., pregnant mothers and their partners). Data on individual and dyadic factors were collected at baseline and post-intervention. Feasibility data indicated that the program was both acceptable and well-received. Participants felt satisfied with the knowledge learned and skills gained in the program (91.6\% of mothers, 90\% of partners). Based on the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, participants demonstrated significant coping skills knowledge increases compared to pre-intervention scores (Z=-2.251, r=0.650, p=0.031 and Z=-2.264, r=0.716, p=0.031, for mothers and partners respectively). In addition, PPD knowledge also increased significantly for both parents (Z=-2.594, r=0.749, p=0.008 and Z=-2.419, r=0.765, p=0.013). Self-esteem increased significantly for mothers and partners as well (Z=-2.816, r=0.813, p=0.002 and Z=-2.657, r=0.840, p=0.006). Non-significant improvements in communication quality, depression, anxiety, social support, and relationship satisfaction for couples (with effect sizes ranging from 0.116 to 0.600) indicate that this program may have the potential to positively influence several individual and joint risk factors for PPD. This study highlights the value of integrating partners more fully into prevention programs for PPD. \textcopyright{} 2022},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Postnatal depression, with an estimated prevalence of 13-19\%, causes significant impairment of mental health among women worldwide and has long term consequences. However, more than half of all cases are not detected by healthcare providers. Screening for postnatal depression has not been given importance in maternal health programs in India. Our objective was to screen for postnatal depression among women attending a rural hospital in India, immediately postpartum and at 6-8 weeks post-delivery, and to study associated factors. Methods: A cross sectional study was done on 123 postnatal women attending a rural maternity hospital in Karnataka, South India, of whom 74 women were interviewed within one week of childbirth, and 49 women at 6-8 weeks post-delivery. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to screen for postnatal depression. Results: About 45.5\% of the women screened positive for postnatal depression (44.6\% of all subjects within one week of delivery and 46.9\% at 6-8 weeks after delivery). Postnatal depression was significantly associated with mood swings during antenatal period, staying with the family of birth during pregnancy and away from their husbands, and was significantly higher among women who perceived their life as stressful and having a low self-esteem (P\textexclamdown 0.05) Conclusions: This study found a high prevalence of postnatal depression in women in rural Karnataka. This underlines the need for incorporating screening for postnatal depression in the routine care of women during pregnancy and delivery. \textcopyright{} 2015, Professional Medical Publications.

It is a time when the mother becomes more vulnerable and this reduced level of control can add to the mother's perception of stress and anxiety. Emotional response can cause physical changes that can negatively affect the pregnancy. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and factors associated with anxiety among out-patient antenatal mother. Design: Cross-sectional study. Materials and Method: A cross sectional survey was conducted with 320 out-patient antenatal mothers from a major teaching hospital in Malaysia. Their anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Descriptive analysis and chi-square were used to evaluate the association between anxiety symptoms with socio-demographic factors, self-esteems and social supports. Result: This study revealed 35.5 \% of the pregnant women experiencing significant anxiety symptoms at their first booking. Factors associated with significant anxiety symptoms among antenatal mother are the total family monthly income, mothers' period of gestations, history of obstetric complication and mothers' self-esteem. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms are prevalent during pregnancy. Intervention to deal with the factors that increase the prevalence of anxiety at this stage is crucial to prevent the development of further psychological problems during pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery. \textcopyright{} 2014 Japan Health Sciences University \& Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to: 1) describe the number, frequency, severity of discomfort and effect of symptoms on life of 29 physical symptoms women experienced at 15 to 25 weeks of gestation; 2) explore whether experiencing this group of physical symptoms more frequently and intensely was associated with a higher score of depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem; (3) examine whether discomfort and effect ratings aided prediction of well being over and above symptom frequency; and (4) investigate which individual physical symptoms contributed most to predicting depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Pregnant women (n = 215) completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and a physical symptoms questionnaire. Frequency, discomfort, and the effect of physical symptoms all consistently correlated with higher scores for depressive symptoms, but less consistently with lower self-esteem. Discomfort and the effect of symptoms predicted variance in depressive symptoms after accounting for symptom frequency. Higher frequency, more discomfort, and the effect of fatigue and effect of flatulence were related to depressive symptoms. Relationships between pregnancy-related physical symptoms, depressive symptoms, and low self-esteem suggest that when women report any of these constellation of factors, further screening is indicated. A comprehensive assessment of physical symptoms includes frequency, discomfort, and effect on life. \textcopyright{} 2009 American College of Nurse-Midwives.},

  abstract = {Despite well-established protocols for the medical management of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), families affected by this rare tumour syndrome continue to face numerous psychological, social, and practical challenges. To our knowledge, this is one of the first qualitative studies to explore the psychosocial difficulties experienced by families affected by VHL. A semi-structured interview was developed to explore patients' and carers' experiences of VHL along several life domains, including: self-identity and self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, education and career opportunities, family communication, physical health and emotional well-being, and supportive care needs. Quantitative measures were also used to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and disease-specific distress in this sample. Participants were recruited via the Hereditary Cancer Clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, Australia. A total of 23 individual telephone interviews were conducted (15 patients, 8 carers), yielding a response rate of 75\%. A diverse range of experiences were reported, including: sustained uncertainty about future tumour development, frustration regarding the need for lifelong medical screening, strained family relationships, difficulties communicating with others about VHL, perceived social isolation and limited career opportunities, financial and care-giving burdens, complex decisions in relation to childbearing, and difficulties accessing expert medical and psychosocial care. Participants also provided examples of psychological growth and resilience, and voiced support for continued efforts to improve supportive care services. More sophisticated systems for connecting VHL patients and their families with holistic, empathic, and person-centred medical and psychosocial care are urgently needed. \textcopyright{} 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) against women during pregnancy and to identify risk factors for DV and effects on women's mental health. METHODS: Pregnant women from an OB-GYN outpatient clinic at a hospital in an urban area were recruited consecutively from February to May 2003. Women who agreed to participate in the research answered three self-administered questionnaires: the GHQ30, the Rosenberg Self Esteem, and one for demographic characteristics at 14 gestational weeks. In order to determine DV prevalence rate during pregnancy, the Japanese version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) for measuring severity of DV was provided to those women over 35 gestational weeks. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy nine women answered all questionnaires. 15 of the 279 respondents (5.4\%) were DV positive during pregnancy based on the Japanese version of the ISA. Nine had experienced physical violence, and twelve had non-physical violence Compared with women who had not experienced DV during pregnancy, DV positive pregnant women were more likely to be multipara (OR = 3.9) and to have experienced physical violence in the past from a different partner (OR = 9.1). Moreover, general illness (OR = 3.8), sleep disturbance (OR = 5.8), anxiety (OR = 6.3), depression (OR = 11.5) and low self-esteem (P = 0.02) were identified as effects of DV on women's mental health. CONCLUSION: Some 5.4\% of women in Japan, approximately 1 in every 20, may experience DV during pregnancy. This is associated with parity and a past history of DV as demographic characteristics, and has an adverse impact on mental health, especially depression. Development of a support system for screening, intervention and referral for DV sufferers is urgently needed.},

However, mental health care is not a component of routine hospital-based antenatal care for medically high-risk pregnant women. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the hospital-based implementation of a Web-based integrated mental health intervention comprising psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for antenatal inpatients. Methods: This study is a quasi-experimental design. Pregnant women are eligible to participate if they are (1) \textexclamdown 37 weeks gestation, (2) admitted to the antenatal inpatient unit for \textquestiondown 72 hours, (3) able to speak and read English or be willing to use a translation service to assist with completion of the questionnaires and intervention, (4) able to complete follow-up email questionnaires, (5) \textquestiondown 16 years of age, and (6) not actively suicidal. Women admitted to the unit for induction (eg, \textexclamdown 72-hour length of stay) are excluded. A minimum sample of 54 women will be recruited from the antenatal high-risk unit of a large, urban tertiary care hospital. All women will complete a Web-based psychosocial assessment and 6 Web-based CBT modules. Results of the psychosocial assessment will be used by a Web-based clinical decision support system to generate a clinical risk score and clinician prompts to provide recommendations for the best treatment and referral options. The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age; birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence at 3-months postpartum; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment and 3-months postpartum. Qualitative interviews with 10-15 health care providers and 15-30 women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results: The study was funded in September, 2014 and ethics was approved in November, 2014. Subject recruitment will begin January, 2015 and results are expected in December, 2015. Results of this study will determine (1) the effectiveness of an integrated Web-based prenatal mental health intervention on maternal and infant outcomes and (2) the feasibility of implementation of the intervention on a high-risk antenatal unit. Conclusions: This study will provide evidence and guidance regarding the implementation of a Web-based mental health program into routine hospital-based care for women with medically high-risk pregnancies. \textcopyright{} 2015 JMIR Publications Inc.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the mental illness or mental health problems during pregnancy in low-and middle-income countries. METHODS: This research is qualitative research. This research was conducted in January\textendash June 2019 in the Bogor independent practice midwife. Informants in the study came from the East Jakarta Health Office, Chair of the Indonesian Midwives Association, Head of the Health Center, Coordinating Midwives, Pregnant Women and husbands, and families of pregnant women. Data are analyzed by Regression Logistic. RESULTS: Construction model mental health of mothers during pregnancy in independent practice midwives is very important and needs attention. Pregnancy is still considered a physical change that needs to be intervened because it is easier to handle and easily detects it. Maternal examination during pregnancy is carried out by midwives, in the implementation of mental health checks during pregnancy for pregnant women, this role has not all been carried out optimally. CONCLUSION: This research suggests conducting socialization with midwives as well as across-related sectors to get political support in carrying out activities in health facilities and independent practice midwives. \textcopyright{} 2020 Nurul Husnul Lail, Rizanda Machmud, Adnil Edwin, Yusrawati Yusrawati, Anwar Mallongi.},

This study was conducted as part of the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition prospective cohort study to identify risk factors of preterm birth. The USDA 18-item scale was used to assess the prevalence of food insecurity among pregnant women with incomes {$\leq$} 400\% of poverty. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to identify socioeconomic, demographic, and psychosocial predictors of household food insecurity. Among 606 pregnant women, 75\% were from fully food-secure, 15\% from marginally food-secure, and 10\% from food-insecure households. Women from marginally food-secure and food-insecure households had significantly less income, less education, and were older than women from fully food-secure households. In bivariate analysis, all psychosocial factors were significantly associated with household food insecurity and showed a dose-response relation with increasing food insecurity. Socioeconomic and demographic predictors for household food insecurity were income, black race, and age. After controlling for socioeconomic and demographic variables, psychosocial indicators of perceived stress, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and a locus of control attributed to chance were positively associated with any household food insecurity. Conversely, self-esteem and mastery were inversely associated with any household food insecurity. Psychosocial factors as well as socioeconomic and demographic indicators are associated with household food insecurity among pregnant women; however, the direction of causation between psychosocial indicators and food insecurity cannot be determined in these data. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Society for Nutrition.},

We tried to determine the factors associated with experiencing menopausal symptoms by Korean postmenopausal women. A total of 657 Korean women who underwent a natural menopause completed multiple questionnaires, which included questions regarding their attitudes to menopause, depressive symptoms, state anxiety, self-esteem, dyadic relationships, sociodemographic variables, and 11-item Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Multiple regression analyses were performed to collectively examine the relative impact of each independent variable on the quality of life, as determined by the MRS. Decreased severity of menopausal symptoms was associated with more time spent in education, an employed status, a history of pregnancy, longer postmenopausal duration, positive attitudes to menopause, higher state anxiety, heightened self-esteem, and higher dyadic consensus. Increased severity of menopausal symptoms was also associated with absence of a partner, alcohol consumption, a history of hormone replacement therapy, a history of probable premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and increased severity of depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, attitudes to menopause, a dyadic relationship with a partner, and the inner psychological status can be associated with the severity of menopause symptoms specifically in Korean postmenopausal women. \textcopyright{} 2010 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.},

  abstract = {Background: Given that the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal depression is high, with estimates around 13\%, and the consequences serious, efforts have been made to identify risk factors to assist in prevention, identification and treatment. Most risk factors associated with postnatal depression have been well researched, whereas predictors of antenatal depression have been less researched. Risk factors associated with early parenting stress have not been widely researched, despite the strong link with depression. The aim of this study was to further elucidate which of some previously identified risk factors are most predictive of three outcome measures: antenatal depression, postnatal depression and parenting stress and to examine the relationship between them. Methods: Primipara and multiparae women were recruited antenatally from two major hoitals as part of the beyondblue National Postnatal Depression Program 1. In this subsidiary study, 367 women completed an additional large battery of validated questionnaires to identify risk factors in the antenatal period at 26-32 weeks gestation. A subsample of these women (N = 161) also completed questionnaires at 10-12 weeks postnatally. Depression level was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Regression analyses identified significant risk factors for the three outcome measures. (1). Significant predictors for antenatal depression: low self-esteem, antenatal anxiety, low social support, negative cognitive style, major life events, low income and history of abuse. (2). Significant predictors for postnatal depression: antenatal depression and a history of depression while also controlling for concurrent parenting stress, which was a significant variable. Antenatal depression was identified as a mediator between seven of the risk factors and postnatal depression. (3). Postnatal depression was the only significant predictor for parenting stress and also acted as a mediator for other risk factors. Conclusion: Risk factor profiles for antenatal depression, postnatal depression and parenting stress differ but are interrelated. Antenatal depression was the strongest predictor of postnatal depression, and in turn postnatal depression was the strongest predictor for parenting stress. These results provide clinical direction suggesting that early identification and treatment of perinatal depression is important. \textcopyright{} 2008 Leigh and Milgrom; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We investigated prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in 283 PHIV and 96 HIV-affected (HIV-negative) young people in England recruited into the Adolescents and Adults Living with Perinatal HIV (AALPHI) cohort. We used Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores and linear regression investigated predictors of higher (worse) scores.115 (41\%) and 29 (30\%) PHIV and HIV-affected young people were male, median age was 16 [interquartile range 15,18] and 16 [14,18] years and 241 (85\%) and 71 (74\%) were black African, respectively. There were no differences in anxiety and depression scores between PHIV and HIV-affected participants. Predictors of higher anxiety scores were a higher number of carers in childhood, speaking a language other than English at home, lower self-esteem, ever thinking life was not worth living and lower social functioning. Predictors of higher depression scores were male sex, death of one/both parents, school exclusion, lower self-esteem and lower social functioning. In conclusion, HIV status was not associated with anxiety or depression scores, but findings highlight the need to identify and support young people at higher risk of anxiety and depression. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Author(s).

The second purpose was to determine the relationship between a comprehensive view of the context of social support and symptoms of depression. Design: Cross-sectional design with convenience sampling (n = 85) of adolescents at 4-6 weeks postpartum, recruited from two community hospitals. Methods: Approval was received from the university's IRB (institutional review board), each recruitment site, the adolescent mothers, and their parents or guardians. Data were collected by a research assistant during home visits using a battery of self-report instruments to measure macro, meso, and microsystems of social support. Demographics, exposure to community violence (macrosystem), social support, social network (mesosystem), and perceived stress, mastery, and self-esteem (microsystem) were predictor variables. Depressive symptoms were measured by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) Scale. Findings: Variables from each system were significant predictors of depressive symptoms but perceived stress was the strongest predictor. Many postpartum adolescents reported that they had been victims of violence. Significant symptoms of depression were identified in 37\% of the postpartum adolescents. Conclusions: Context is important to consider in comparing international studies of social support. Researchers and clinicians should investigate variables associated with the low incidence of treatment for depressive symptoms in postpartum adolescents. Clinical Relevance: Feelings of high self-esteem and mastery should be fostered in nursing interventions with postpartum adolescents and routine screening for symptoms of depression should be considered in relevant healthcare settings. \textcopyright{} 2008 Sigma Theta Tau International.},

Subjects and methods: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI- 2) were administered during peripartum to a sample of 54 women recruited at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Unit, Perugia (Italy). Results: Results were grouped according to the EPDS ranges 0-8 and \textquestiondown 9, and to the MMPI-2 scores on each clinical scale. Women with APD had high scores on the MMPI-2 Hypomania, Cynicism, and Antisocial Practices scales; women with early onset PPD (detected in the first week after childbirth) had high scores on the Paranoia and Low Self-Esteem scales; women with late onset PPD (detected up to three months after childbirth), had high scores on the Fears, Obsessiveness, and Depression scales. Conclusions: Based on the high scores of specific MMPI-2 scales, our study would suggest that: Cluster B personality features may represent a vulnerability factor for APD; passive-aggressive personality features may be a vulnerability factor for early onset PPD; cluster C personality features may act as a vulnerability factor for late onset PPD. \textcopyright{} 2017 Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia.},

Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out with 1,120 pregnant women aged 18-49 years old, who were registered in the Family Health Program in the city of Recife, Northeastern Brazil, between 2005 and 2006. Common mental disorders were assessed using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Intimate partner violence was defined as psychologically, physically and sexually abusive acts committed against women by their partners. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were estimated for the association studied utilizing logistic regression analysis. Results: The most common form of partner violence was psychological. The prevalence of common mental disorders was 71.0\% among women who reported all form of violence in pregnancy and 33.8\% among those who did not report intimate partner violence. Common mental disorders were associated with psychological violence (OR 2.49, 95\%CI 1.8;3.5), even without physical or sexual violence. When psychological violence was combined with physical or sexual violence, the risk of common mental disorders was even higher (OR 3.45; 95\%CI 2.3;5.2). Conclusions: Being assaulted by someone with whom you are emotionally involved can trigger feelings of helplessness, low self-esteem and depression. The pregnancy probably increased women's vulnerability to common mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Background: Although legal, elective abortion is a common procedure, questions about possible mental health risks associated with abortion persist. This study examined the abortionrelated emotions and overall mental health of women before and after a first-trimester abortion of an unintended pregnancy. Method: Women at 3 abortion providers (N = 1043) were randomly asked to participate in the study; 882 (85\%) entered the study. Participants underwent assessments 1 hour before abortion and 1 hour, 1 month (N = 615), and 2 years (N = 442) after abortion. Assessments included preabortion and postabortion depression and self-esteem, positive and negative emotions after abortion, satisfaction with the decision to have an abortion, perception of harm, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results: Two years after abortion, relief was experienced by subjects more often than either positive or negative emotions, and decision satisfaction was more common than dissatisfaction (72\% vs. 16\%). In addition, 69\% of women reported 2 years postabortion that they would make the same decision to have the abortion, and 72\% noted more benefit than harm due to the abortion. Depression was reported in 20\% of women and PTSD in 1\% at 2-year follow-up. Although depression was lower and self-esteem was higher after than before abortion, negative emotions increased and decision satisfaction decreased over 2 years. Women with a history of depression before pregnancy had higher incidence of depression, lower self-esteem, and more negative abortion-related emotions and evaluations after 2 years. Younger age and greater number of live births before abortion were associated with negative evaluation of abortion. Conclusions: Although some women experienced psychological problems and regret after having an abortion, most did not. History of depression before pregnancy consistently predicted poorer postabortion mental health. Copyright 2002 Physicians Postgraduate press, Inc.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy and identification of the socio-demographic and psychosocial factors. Material and methods. The study was prospective and longitudinal, and the research group consisted of 314 adult pregnant women. To assess the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was applied. To assess the psychosocial variables the Rosenberg Self-Assessment Scale, Marital Communication Questionnaire and the Berlin Social Support Scale and authors' Socio-demographical questionnaire were used. To assess the normal distribution the Shapiro-Wilk test was used. For non-parametric tests the Mann Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis ANOVA were used due to the distribution of the variables tested against the intergroup comparisons that deviate from the normal distribution. Results and conclusions. Co-existence of anxiety and depression in different trimesters amounted relatively to 12.7\% in the first trimester, 10.8\% in the second trimester and 12.4\% in the third trimester of pregnancy. Symptoms of anxiety were often experienced by unmarried women, non-working women, and those respondents who estimated their housing and financial situation as being worse. Those most susceptible to depressive symptoms were tested women with primary education and those who assessed as worse their financial and housing situation. Higher self-esteem, good communication in a relationship, satisfying social support was associated with a lower incidence of anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. Higher self-esteem, good communication in a relationship, and satisfying social support was associated with a lower incidence of anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background Peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders are associated with adverse consequences for mother and child. Thus, it is important to examine risk factors, correlates and course patterns of anxiety and depressive disorders during pregnancy and after delivery. Methods In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n=306 expectant mothers were recruited from gynaecological outpatient settings in Germany and completed up to seven waves of assessment from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum. Anxiety and depressive disorders and potential risk factors/correlates were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V), medical records and additional questionnaires. Results Although peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders appeared to be persistent in some women, others reported major changes with heterogeneous courses and shifts between diagnoses and contents. There was a considerable amount of incident disorders. Strongest predictors for peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders were anxiety and depressive disorders prior to pregnancy, but psychosocial (e.g. maternal education), individual (e.g. low self-esteem), and interpersonal (e.g. partnership satisfaction, social support) factors were also related. Limitation Knowing the aims of the study, some participants may have been more encouraged to report particular symptoms, but if so, this points to the importance of a comprehensive assessment in perinatal care. Conclusion Peripartum time is a sensitive period for a considerable incidence or persistence/recurrence of anxiety and depressive disorders albeit the course may be rather heterogeneous. Interventional studies are needed to examine whether an alteration of associated factors could help to prevent peripartum anxiety and depressive disorders. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Few studies on postpartum depression have been undertaken on pregnant women with a low socioeconomic status. The present study aims to recognize the prevalence of postpartum depression and association with risk factors in low socioeconomic populations. Predicting risk factors during pregnancy for postpartum depression are so important. 451 low income pregnant women referred to health care centres, participated in a prospective study. Questionnaires covered demographics and, obstetrics and psychological characteristics were collected by interviews. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to define depression in pregnancy as a sum score {$\geq$}10 and in postpartum as a sum score {$\geq$}13 at gestational week 28. The mean participant age was 25 years. Most of them had moderate perceived stress (61\%), low self-esteem (63.2\%), low perceived social support (67.6\%), and low quality of marital relationship (43.5\%). Fear related to childbirth was high in more than half of respondents (50.8\%) and 58.9\% had prenatal depression. The frequency of postnatal depression was 39\% in participants. Those with postpartum depression had lower self-esteem scores, higher perceived stress and higher childbirth related fear in both mothers with postpartum depression and mothers without it. The prevalence of depression in pregnancy was higher in low socio-economic primigravidea from Iran. The increased risk persisted after adjustment for risk factors. \textcopyright{} 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

  abstract = {Background: Obstetric fistula is an abnormal opening between the vagina and bladder or rectum. Women affected by obstetric fistula are often abandoned by their husbands, stigmatized by the community, physically debilitated and blamed for their conditions. These factors lead the victims to low self esteem, depression and prolonged emotional trauma. The physical, emotional and social suffering associated with continuous leakage of urine has a profound impact on women quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess quality of life and associated factors among obstetric fistula patients in Ethiopia, and it will have a significant role for further intervention. Objective: To assess quality of life and associated factors among obstetric fistula patients in Ethiopia, 2017. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted at fistula centers in Ethiopia. Systematic sampling technique was used to recruit a total of 289 women with obstetric fistula. The World Health Organization Quality of Life\textemdash Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) Version was used to assess quality of life. We computed simple and multiple linear regression analysis to assess factors associated with quality of life and P-value \textexclamdown{} 0.05 was declared statistically significant. Adjusted unstandardized {$\beta$} coefficient of multiple linear regressions was used to describe associated factors of quality of life. Result: Of 289 women studied, only 12.1\% felt satisfied with their general state of health and quality of life. In the physical health domain, the mean quality of life score was 40.78 {$\pm$}.78. In the psychological domain, the mean quality of life score was 39.96 {$\pm$}.82. In the social and environmental domain, the mean quality of life score was 32.9 {$\pm$}.95, 36.45 {$\pm$}.8, respectively.

Conclusion and recommendation: Co-morbid depression and anxiety, poor social support, duration of urine incontinence, employment, number of children, and duration of hospital stay were factors significantly associated with domains of QOL. Treating co-morbid depression and anxiety, and social support are necessary to increase women's quality of life. In addition, it is better to have a plane of income generation victims, and awareness creation about early treatment of the problem for community by the concerned body to improve women quality of life. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

Method: The sample (N=567) was recruited as part of 91 antenatal courses. Women were screened between the 6th and 12th week after birth, by filling the EPDS (Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale). The validated cut-off score of \&gt;12 was used. Socio-demographic and clinical variables were investigated. Results: Out of the 567 screened women, 42 (7.4\%) were positive. A higher risk was found in women who, during pregnancy, had a depressed mood (OR=3.2) or suffered from anxiety (OR=6.3), had little (OR=4.8) or no (OR=6.5) psychological support from friends or family, or their partner (OR=4.4), had a baby given to crying (OR=7.8), had a low self-esteem (OR=4.8), or had had, as children, a mother that was often (OR=4.6) or always (OR=12.5) critical of them. Discussions and conclusions: The results of the study are in agreement with the literature considering social and family support and the presence of anxiety and/or depression during pregnancy as main risk factors for PPD. In disagreement with previous studies on risk factors for depressive disorders, we found that the economic status was not associated to PPD.},

  abstract = {Objectives More than 10 \% of pregnant women in the United States (U.S.) suffer from depression, which has far-reaching consequences on maternal and fetal well-being. There is conflicting evidence regarding the prevalence of antenatal depression among different race and ethnic groups. This systematic review aimed to summarize the existing literature concerning racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence and correlates of antenatal depression in the U.S. Methods PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases were searched online for research studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals until March 2015, using a pre-designed search strategy. Eligibility was determined using pre-specified criteria; and quality was assessed. Results Forty-one (41) articles met the criteria; 13 were cross-sectional, and 21 were longitudinal studies. Overall, the prevalence of antenatal depression was 10\textendash 30 \%; it was higher among non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and Hispanics, compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Few studies looked at the correlates of depression by race/ethnicity. Among employed women, higher depression scores were observed among NHBs, compared to NHWs; while there was no racial difference among unemployed women. Racial difference and race-employment interaction disappeared once discrimination was accounted for. In another study, higher parity, higher stress, and lower self-esteem were significant correlates of depression among NHBs, while less satisfaction with social support, and higher stress predicted higher depression scores among NHWs and Hispanics respectively. Conclusions The findings of our review suggest that not only is antenatal depression a major public health issue that needs to be addressed, but different racial/ethnic groups seem to differ in their vulnerability and risk factors. \textcopyright{} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Recent Findings: Binge eating/binge eating disorder, loss of control eating, emotional eating, and food addiction are all fairly prevalent among individuals with excess weight. They appear to share many of the same correlates, including broader eating disorder psychopathology, body/shape/weight concerns, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and third-wave (e.g., acceptance, mindfulness) therapies appear effective in improving binge eating, loss of control eating, emotional eating, associated features (e.g., weight and shape concerns), and psychological distress (e.g., depression). Summary: Certain forms of disordered eating are elevated among individuals with excess weight, and psychosocial interventions have been found effective in improving symptomatology. Empirical research examining the efficacy of treatments for food addiction is lacking, and greatly needed given both its rate and controversy. \textcopyright{} 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The obstetrician-gynecologist should be aware of factors that contribute to the high prevalence of depression in women, and particular attention should be given to family and work roles, victimization, early childhood loss of parent, personality variables, and reproductive-related events such as pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. It is also important to distinguish between a grief reaction and major depression. Grief occurs secondary to losses such as abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or infertility and is generally self-limiting; self-esteem is preserved. In major depression, changes in sleeping patterns, appetite, energy, and mood persist, along with loss of self-esteem. As a part of patient education, it should be emphasized that depression is a medical illness and not a character defect or weakness and that in most cases it can be treated effectively. However, the risk of recurrence is significant; patients should be alert to early signs and symptoms of recurrence and seek treatment. Antidepressants that are well tolerated are now available, and appropriate use of these medications, along with psychotherapy as needed, will provide effective treatment for most patients. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

We performed a review of the literature investigating the epidemiology of adolescents mothers' depression, compared these data to adult mothers and listed associated factors, to develop a more preventive approach and specific follow-up. Methods: The review is based on Pubmed and Sciencedirect research combining "adolescent" or "teenage" and "depression" as keywords. Results: Seventeen international studies were included, evaluating both prenatal (6 studies) and postnatal (14 studies) depression with three different scales (CES-D, BDI, EPDS). Depression rate in adolescents mothers varies from 26 to 63\% in the third trimester of pregnancy and from 26 to 61\% in the first 3 months postpartum, with differences depending of studies designs, screening instruments and cut-offs. Depression rate declines with time, but still persists with a prevalence ranging from 21 to 32\% at 4 to 5 years after delivery. Depression rate in adolescent mothers are globally twice higher than in adult mothers, both in prenatal and postnatal periods. Characteristics associated with adolescent mothers depression include sociodemographic factors (less education, low income), psychosocial factors (confidence, self-esteem), poor or inadequate social support and negative life events (violence exposure, history of abuse). Conclusion: Perinatal depression in adolescent mothers is very high and can contribute negatively to child-mother interaction. It should be a priority to screen depression early during pregnancy and to offer appropriate support services during the first years of motherhood. Moreover, it could be of high interest to assess maternofoetal attachment during pregnancy using validated instruments combined with depression scales. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

METHOD: One hundred- sixty one women within one year after delivery from one public health center located in the northern area of Seoul were used in this study. The instruments were a survey of general characteristics, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, recent life events index, perceived social support from family, Quality of marriage index, parenting stress index, and Rosenberg's self-esteem inventory. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and logistic regression. RESULT: The average item score of the EPDS was 6.67. 12.4\% of respondents, who scored above a threshold 12, were likely to be suffering from a depression of varying severity. The fitness of the model for explaining postpartum depression from six variables, plan for pregnancy, family support, quality of marital relation, perceived social support, life events, childcare stress, and self-esteem, was statistically significant and the predictive power of these variables was 90.9\%. The significant predictors of postpartum depression were family support and child care stress. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to identify the prevalence rate of postpartum depression using more reliable sampling methods from a large general population. Nursing interventions need to be developed for promoting family support and reducing childcare stress.},

  abstract = {Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the most common cause of hair loss in women at any age. Clinical presentation of FPHL differs from its male counterpart, male pattern baldness. Women tend to present earlier with a reduction in hair volume from diffuse thinning over the crown and rarely with fronto-temporal recession. The diffuse hair thinning results from androgen-mediated miniaturization of hair follicles in addition to decrease in hair fiber length. Histologically, hair follicle miniaturization and a decrease in terminal-to-vellus hair ratio are diagnostic features of FPHL, and are also identical to that seen in male pattern baldness. The role of androgens in FPHL has not been clearly established, and most women with androgenetic alopecia have normal serum androgen levels; however, antiandrogen medications can still be effective in the treatment. Several medical treatments are available for the management of FPHL, with variable efficacy. Other measures to camouflage hair loss are popular. Increasingly, for many women hair transplantation is a suitable option. While an association between female androgenetic alopecia and cardiovascular disease risk factors has recently been suggested, the morbidity associated with this condition is mostly psychosocial and clinicians need to be aware of it to address it appropriately. \textcopyright{} 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background: Globally, depression is prevalent during pregnancy and several factors have been associated with antenatal depressive symptoms (ADS). However, ADS have rarely been investigated in Thailand. This study aimed at exploring the prevalence of ADS and factors associated with these symptoms among Thai women in late pregnancy. Methods: A cross-sectional study including 449 women in late pregnancy was carried out. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to detect depressive symptoms with a score of 10 points or higher. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial risks were measured in association with ADS. Percentage and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the prevalence of ADS. Odds ratio (OR) and 95\%CI were used to determine ADS-related risk factors among women. Results: The prevalence of ADS was 46.8\% (95\%CI 42.3\textendash 51.4). Pregnant women aged less than 20 years (OR 2.58, 95\%CI 1.14\textendash 5.84) and those not having enough money (OR 2.71, 95\%CI 1.22\textendash 6.05) had an increased risk of ADS. Psychosocial risks related to ADS for women were low psychological well-being (OR 3.12, 95\%CI 1.75\textendash 5.58), low self-esteem (OR 2.08, 95\%CI 1.24\textendash 3.49), and low sense of coherence (OR 1.82, 95\%CI 1.12\textendash 2.95). Conclusions: The prevalence of ADS among Thai women in their late pregnancy is high. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial factors are independently associated with ADS. Healthcare providers in Thailand should consider EPDS as a standardised screening tool for ADS and use it at antenatal care clinics. Implementing programs focusing on both pregnant women and their family might increase the prevention of perinatal depression. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to determine prevalence of childbirth fear among uncomplicated pregnant women in Siriraj Hospital and possible associated factors. A total of 305 uncomplicated, singleton pregnant women were enrolled during early third trimester. All participants were interviewed regarding baseline demographic, social, economic, family, and obstetric characteristics. Fear of childbirth (FOC) was evaluated by Thai version of Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire Version A (W-DEQ). W-DEQ scores and level of FOC were compared between various characteristics to determine possible associated factors. Mean W-DEQ score was 51.9. Prevalence of low, moderate, high, and severe FOC were 18.4\%, 64.9\%, 16.1\%, and 0.7\%, respectively. Mean FOC score was significantly higher in women with unplanned than planned pregnancy (p =.033). Women with high to severe FOC were significantly less likely to have adequate income (p =.03), have family support (p =.02), have been told about delivery (p =.03), and have witnessed delivery (p =.01).IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Prevalence of fear of childbirth (FOC) in Western countries varies from 8 to 27\%. FOC have been related to several unwanted conditions, including obstetrics complications, operative vaginal delivery, increased analgesic use in labour, elective caesarean section, postpartum depression, and impaired maternal-infant relation. Several factors related to FOC have been reported, including maternal age, parity, gestational age, history of a vacuum or forceps extraction, previous caesarean section, previous adverse perinatal outcome, low education, low socio-economic level, psychiatric problems, personality, lack of social support, and low self-esteem. What do the results of this study add? Prevalence of low, moderate, high, and severe FOC in Siriraj Hospital were 18.4\%, 64.9\%, 16.1\%, and 0.7\%, respectively. This was relatively lower than those reported from Western countries. Mean FOC score was significantly higher in women with unplanned than planned pregnancy. High to severe FOC was significantly related to low financial and family support and less understandings on delivery process. Differences in the results might be partly due to the differences in study population characteristics of Thais, including ethnics, religions, beliefs, perceptions, social structures, and social norms. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Future researches are suggested to explore and understand more about social and cultural factors associated with FOC. Identification of women with high or severe degree of FOC could help in preparing the women at risk before or during pregnancy to lessen FOC in order to improve their childbirth experiences. In addition, effective interventions to reduce FOC should be developed, evaluated, and implemented in the future. \textcopyright{} 2019, \textcopyright{} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Detecting types and frequent psychological side effects of abortion among post abortion care seeking women in Tehran was the main objective of the present study. Method: 278 women of reproductive age (15-49) interviewed as study population. Response rate was 93/8. Data collected through a questionnaire with 2 parts meeting broad socio-economic characteristics of the respondents and health-related abortion consequences. Tehran hospitals were the site of study. Results: The results revealed that at least one-third of the respondents have experienced psychological side effects. Depression, worrying about not being able to conceive again and abnormal eating behaviors were reported as dominant psychological consequences of abortion among the respondents. Decreased self-esteem, nightmare, guilt, and regret with 43.7\%, 39.5\%, 37.5\%, and 33.3\% prevalence rates have been placed in the lower status, respectively. Conclusion: Psychological consequences of abortion have considerably been neglected. Several barriers made findings limited. Different types of psychological side effects, however, experienced by the study population require more intensive attention because of chronic characteristic of psychological disorders, and women's health impact on family and population health.},

  abstract = {Background: South Africa (SA) has the greatest HIV prevalence in the world, with rates as high as 40\% among pregnant women. Depression is a robust predictor of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and engagement in HIV care; perinatal depression may affect upwards of 47\% of women in SA. Evidence-based, scalable approaches for depression treatment and ART adherence in this setting are lacking. Method: Twenty-three pregnant women with HIV (WWH), ages 18\textendash 45 and receiving ART, were randomized to a psychosocial depression and adherence intervention or treatment as usual (TAU) to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect on depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Assessments were conducted pre-, immediately post-, and 3 months post-treatment, and included a qualitative exit interview. Results: Most (67.6\%) eligible individuals enrolled; 71\% completed at least 75\% of sessions. Compared to TAU, intervention participants had significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms at post-treatment, {$\beta$} = - 11.1, t(24) = - 3.1, p \textexclamdown{} 0.005, 95\% CI [- 18.41, - 3.83], and 3 months, {$\beta$} = - 13.8, t(24) = - 3.3, p \textexclamdown{} 0.005, 95\% CI [- 22.50, - 5.17]. No significant differences in ART adherence, social support, or stigma were found. Qualitatively, perceived improvements in social support, self-esteem, and problem-solving adherence barriers emerged as key benefits of the intervention; additional sessions were desired. Conclusion: A combined depression and ART adherence intervention appears feasible and acceptable, and demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy in a high-need population. Additional research is needed to confirm efficacy and identify dissemination strategies to optimize the health of WWH and their children.

  abstract = {Objective: After a diagnosis of infertility, an increasing number of couples turns to the Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR) to achieve a pregnancy. A diagnosis of infertility has a negative impact on the individual's well-being and it can increase the risk of anxious-depressive symptoms, stress, and low self-esteem. Data associated with infertility-related Quality of Life (QoL) are lacking in men. Little is known about men's experience of infertility and its treatments during the pandemic. Among the variables potentially associated with infertility-related QoL, the role of obsessive beliefs is neglected, although preliminary studies considered perfectionistic traits. Method: One hundred and fifty-one participants were included. Eighty men (mean age: 40.83 years) were attending a MAR pathway. Of these, 50 men (67.5\%) were undergoing homologous MAR and 30 men (37.5\%) were undergoing heterologous MAR. A control group consisting of 71 subjects (mean age: 36.69 years), paired by age, marital status, and number of children, was drawn from the general population. The Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-46, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-20, and the Fertility Quality of Life Questionnaire were administered. Results: High levels of anxiety, depression and stress were moderately associated with lower infertility-related Quality of Life. For men undergoing homologous MAR, perfectionism beliefs represented a vulnerability factor for a lower fertility-related QoL, while for men undergoing heterologous MAR, high thought control beliefs represented a risk factor for a lower fertility-related QoL. Conclusions: A focus on the obsessive beliefs should be included in the psychological treatment of infertile men, specifically perfectionism in homologous MAR and control of thoughts in heterologous MAR. Therefore, psychological assessment and support interventions should be personalized according to the MAR pathway and be focused on men's cognitive features in order to improve their QoL during the MAR pathway. \textcopyright{} 2021 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.},

Methods: This study examined prevalence and patterns of depressive symptoms among 181 urban, low-income, first-time, African American adolescent mothers recruited from urban hospitals following delivery. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at 6 (N = 148; 82\%) and 24 (N = 147; 81\%) month home visits. Depressive symptoms were measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Half of mothers (49\%) had BDI scores \textquestiondown 9 at baseline, with significant correlations between BDI scores across all visits (r = 0.28-0.50). Depressive symptom trajectories analyzed using group-based trajectory modeling revealed three trajectories of depressive symptoms: Low (41\%), Medium (45\%), and High (14\%). The high depressive symptom group reported lower self-esteem, more negative life events, and lower parenting satisfaction than the low and moderate depressive symptoms groups. Limitations: Depressive symptoms were self-reported and not verified with a clinical interview. Findings are limited to urban, low-income, African American adolescent mothers and may not be generalizable to other populations. Conclusions: The high prevalence and relative stability of depressive symptoms through 2 years of parenting suggest the need for early identification and treatment of maternal depressive symptoms. Brief screening for maternal depressive symptoms conducted during pediatric well-child visits is a feasible and effective method for identifying mothers with depressive symptoms, however, screening measures can not differentiate between high and low levels of depressive symptoms. Brief intervention may be an effective treatment for mothers with mild symptoms of depression; mothers with moderate to severe symptoms may require more intensive intervention. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Background: Intimate partner abuse is common in all societies and damages the health of survivors and their children in the short and long term. Advocacy may decrease the impact of this abuse on women's health. Objectives: To assess the effects of advocacy interventions conducted within or outside of health care settings on women who have experienced intimate partner abuse. Search strategy: We searched: CENTRAL and DARE (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to 31/7/08), EMBASE (1980 to 2008 week 30), and 11 other databases, to end July 2008. We also searched relevant websites, reference lists and forward citation tracking of included studies, and handsearched six key journals. We contacted principal investigators and experts in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing advocacy interventions for women with experience of intimate partner abuse against usual care. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and undertook data extraction. For binary outcomes we calculated a standardised estimation of the odds ratio (OR) and for continuous data we calculated either a standardised mean difference (SMD) or a weighted mean difference (WMD), both with a 95\% confidence interval. Main results: We included ten trials involving 1527 participants. The studies were heterogeneous in respect of: intensity of advocacy, outcome measures and duration of follow-up (immediately post-intervention to three years), permitting meta-analysis for only a minority of outcomes. Intensive advocacy (12 hours or more duration) may help terminate physical abuse in women leaving domestic violence shelters or refuges at 12-24 months follow-up (OR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.80), but not at up to 12 months follow-up. The evidence indicates that intensive advocacy may improve quality of life at up to 12 months follow-up, but the confidence intervals included zero (WMD 0.23, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.46). Depression did not improve following intensive advocacy at up to 12 months follow-up (WMD -0.05, 95\% CI -0.19 to 0.09), nor did psychological distress (SMD -0.16, 95\% CI -0.39 to 0.06). Only two meta-analyses of brief advocacy interventions (less than 12 hours duration) were possible; an increased use of safety behaviours was consistent with the receipt of brief advocacy both at up to 12 months (WMD 0.60, 95\% CI 0.14 to 1.06) and at 12-24 months (WMD 0.48, 95\% CI 0.04 to 0.92) follow up. Authors' conclusions: Based on the evidence reviewed, it is possible that intensive advocacy for women recruited in domestic violence shelters or refuges reduces physical abuse one to two years after the intervention but we do not know if it has a beneficial effect on their quality of life and mental health. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to show if less intensive interventions in healthcare settings for women who still live with the perpetrators of violence are effective.

  abstract = {Background: Intimate partner abuse is common worldwide, damaging the short- and long-term physical, mental, and emotional health of survivors and children. Advocacy may contribute to reducing abuse, empowering women to improve their situation by providing informal counselling and support for safety planning and increasing access to different services. Advocacy may be a stand-alone service, accepting referrals from healthcare providers, or part of a multi-component (and possibly multi-agency) intervention provided by service staffor others. Objectives: To assess the effects of advocacy interventions within or outside healthcare settings in women who have experienced intimate partner abuse. Search methods: In April 2015, we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 10 other databases. We also searched WHO ICTRP, mRCT, and UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN), and examined relevant websites and reference lists with forward citation tracking of included studies. For the original review we handsearched six key journals. We also contacted first authors of eligible papers and experts in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing advocacy interventions for women with experience of intimate partner abuse versus no intervention or usual care (if advocacy was minimal and fewer than 20\% of women received it). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and undertook data extraction. We contacted authors for missing information needed to calculate statistics for the review and looked for adverse events. Main results: We included 13 trials involving 2141 participants aged 15 to 65 years, frequently having low socioeconomic status. The studies were quite heterogeneous in terms of methodology, study processes and design, including with regard to the duration of follow-up (postintervention to three years), although this was not associated with differences in effect. The studies also had considerable clinical heterogeneity in relation to staffdelivering advocacy; setting (community, shelter, antenatal, healthcare); advocacy intensity (from 30 minutes to 80 hours); and abuse severity. Three trials evaluated advocacy within multi-component interventions. Eleven measured some form of abuse (eight scales), six assessed quality of life (three scales), and six measured depression (three scales). Countries and ethnic groups varied (one or more minority ethnic groups in the USA or UK, and local populations in Hong Kong and Peru). Setting was associated with intensity and duration of advocacy. Risk of bias was high in five studies, moderate in five, and low in three. The quality of evidence (considering multiple factors such as risk of bias, study size, missing data) was moderate to low for brief advocacy and very low for intensive advocacy. Incidence of abuse Physical abuse Moderate quality pooled data from two healthcare studies (moderate risk of bias) and one community study (low risk of bias), all with 12-month follow-up data, showed no effect on physical abuse for brief (\textexclamdown{} 12 hours) advocacy interventions (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.00, 95\% confidence interval (CI) - 0.17 to 0.16; n = 558). One antenatal study (low risk of bias) showed an association between brief advocacy and reduced minor physical abuse at one year (mean difference (MD) change - 1.00, 95\% CI - 1.82 to - 0.18; n = 110). An antenatal, multi-component study showed a greater likelihood of physical abuse ending (odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.75) immediately after advocacy (number needed to treat (NNT) = 8); we cannot exclude impact from other components. Low to very low quality evidence from two intensive advocacy trials (12 hours plus duration) showed reduced severe physical abuse in women leaving a shelter at 24 months (OR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.20 to 0.77; NNT = 8), but not at 12 or 36 months. Sexual abuse Meta-analysis of two studies (n = 239) showed no effect of advocacy on sexual abuse (SMD - 0.12, 95\% CI - 0.37 to 0.14), agreeing with the change score (MD - 0.07, 95\% CI - 0.30 to 0.16) from a third study and the OR (0.96, 95\% CI 0.44 to 2.12) from a fourth antenatal, multi-component study. Emotional abuse One study in antenatal care, rated at low risk of bias, showed reduced emotional abuse at {$\leq$} 12-month follow-up (MD (change score) - 4.24, 95\% CI - 6.42 to - 2.06; n = 110). Psychosocial health Quality of life Meta-analysis of two studies (high risk of bias) showed intensive advocacy slightly improved overall quality of life of women recruited from shelters (MD 0.23, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.46; n = 343) at 12-month follow-up, with greater improvement in perceived physical quality of life from a primary care study (high risk of bias; MD 4.90, 95\% CI 0.98 to 8.82) immediately postintervention. Depression Meta-analysis of two studies in healthcare settings, one at high risk of bias and one at moderate risk, showed that fewer women developed depression (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.65; n = 149; NNT = 4) with brief advocacy. One study at high risk of bias reported a slight reduction in depression in pregnant women immediately after the intervention (OR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.20 to 1.29; n = 103; NNT = 8). There was no evidence that intensive advocacy reduced depression at {$\leq$} 12-month follow-up (MD - 0.14, 95\% CI - 0.33 to 0.05; 3 studies; n = 446) or at two years (SMD - 0.12, 95\% CI - 0.36 to 0.12; 1 study; n = 265). Adverse effects Two women died, one who was murdered by her partner and one who committed suicide. No evidence links either death to study participation. Authors' conclusions: Results suggest some benefits from advocacy. However, most studies were underpowered. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity largely precluded pooling of trials. Therefore, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of benefit, the impact of abuse severity, and the setting. Based on the evidence reviewed, intensive advocacy may improve short-term quality of life and reduce physical abuse one to two years after the intervention for women recruited from domestic violence shelters or refuges. Brief advocacy may provide small short-term mental health benefits and reduce abuse, particularly in pregnant women and for less severe abuse. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To identify the prevalence of risk behaviors and related risk factors in adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods: Youth risk behavior survey questionnaires were collected from 2311 adolescents in 8 schools, 13 communities and 2 Juvenile Home Institutions from January to February 2001. Their mean age was 15.5 {$\pm$} 1.8 years, and 59\% were female. Risk factors of interest were gender, parental marital status, socioeconomic status, family relationship, parental drug addiction, peer group, loneliness, self-esteem, and school performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors associated with each risk behavior. Results: The risk behaviors leading to traffic accidents were rarely or never having worn a seat belt (30.6\%) or helmet while bicycling (66.9\%) and while motorcycling (50.1\%), riding with drivers who had consumed alcohol (18.8\%), and driving after consuming alcohol (12.1\%). The studied group carried weapons (8.5\%) and has been involved in a violent event (31.5\%). Among 13.9\% who were assaulted, 6.7\% needed hospitalization; rape was reported by 2.4\%. Depression was reported by 19.9\%, with 12\% having suicidal tendencies and 8\% attempting suicide. The lifetime use vs. heavy use prevalence of substance abuse, respectively, was: 15.4\% and 3.5\% for smoking, 37.3\% and 1.7\% for alcohol, 37.8\% and 4.6\% for amphetamine use, and 37.9\% and 0.1\% for other drugs. Among the 10\% who have had sexual intercourse, 1\% were homosexual, 7.1\% have never used a condom, and 2.1\% resulted in pregnancy. Being male was a risk factor for every untoward behavior except depression. Other risk factors included poor self-esteem, poor school performance, and early school leaving. Factors relating to the family included a low socioeconomic status, poor relationships, broken families, and parental substance abuse. Socioenvironmental factors included being in a gang and loneliness. Some risk behaviors started at younger than 8 years old. Schools and media were given as the sources of information regarding sex, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and substance abuse.

  abstract = {Severe fear of childbirth complicates 6\% to 10\% of parturients and is manifested as nightmares, physical complaints and difficulties in concentrating on work or on family activities. Very often fear of childbirth leads to request for an elective cesarean section (CS). In Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, fear of childbirth or maternal request is the reason for about 7-22\% of CS births. Fear of childbirth is as common in nulliparous as in parous women. Fear of labor pain is strongly associated with the fear of pain in general, and a previous complicated childbirth or inadequate pain relief are the most common reasons for requesting a CS among parous women. Previous psychological morbidity and a great number of daily stressors expose a woman to a great risk of fear of childbirth. Fear of childbirth is not an isolated problem but associated with the woman's personal characteristics, mainly general anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression, and dissatisfaction with their partnership, and lack of support. Also the partners of women with fear have a certain pattern of low psychological well-being, resulting in low life-satisfaction, dissatisfaction with partnerships, and depression. A vivid debate about the woman's right to choose the mode of delivery is going on in obstetric literature, but discussion on the reasons for women to request a CS, or on the possibilities to help them overcome the fear of vaginal childbirth is scanty. Preliminary Swedish and Finnish reports demonstrated the results of treatment during pregnancy, when more than half of the women withdrew their request after being able to discuss their anxiety and fear, and vaginal deliveries after treatment were successful.},

This review describes the relationship of BED to physical and mental health, quality of life, and functionality. Data Sources: PubMed searches were conducted on March 21, 2014; searches were limited to English-language research articles, meta-analyses, and reviews published between January 1, 2003 and March 21, 2014. Search terms included (binge eating OR binge-eating OR binge eating disorder) AND (cardiovascular OR metabolic OR metabolic syndrome OR gastrointestinal OR health OR rehabilitation OR recovery OR sleep OR pregnancy OR quality of life OR functional impairment OR activities of daily living OR QoL OR SF-12 OR ED-5D OR SF-36 OR psychosocial OR depressive OR anxiety OR self-esteem OR suicidality OR suicide OR productivity OR family). Study Selection/Data Extraction: Of 326 identified publications, 43 were relevant to the topic and reported on the association of BED with psychiatric and medical comorbidities, quality of life, and functional outcomes. Results: Individuals diagnosed with BED have increased rates of mental health comorbidities (eg, depression and anxiety) and more pronounced medical impairments (eg, cardiovascular disorders) compared with individuals without BED. BED is also associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Conclusions: Binge eating disorder is associated with impairments in physical and mental health, which can decrease quality of life and functionality and lead to increased health care utilization and decreased productivity. However, some caution is warranted in interpreting these findings because it remains unclear whether BED is an antecedent condition, a complication associated with a comorbid psychiatric condition, or an unrelated feature that occurs concurrently with these comorbidities and impairments. Much of the research on BED is based on observational or epidemiologic studies. Controlled studies are needed to clearly define the long-term impairments associated with BED. \textcopyright{} 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.},

No studies to date have observed maternal depression and suicide at immediate prenatal and early postpartum stages. In total, 213 Chinese women were recruited in hospitals after they were admitted for childbirth. All completed a short-term longitudinal survey at perinatal stages. Women reported lower depression scores (6.65) and higher suicidal ideation incidence (11.74\%) after childbirth. Prenatal depression raised the possibility of prenatal suicidal ideation, while prenatal depression and suicidal ideation increased postpartum depression and suicidal ideation. At immediate prenatal stage, marital satisfaction protected women from depression, while miscarriage experiences and self-esteem increased the risk. At early postpartum stage, in contrast, being first-time mother, marital satisfaction, and harmony with mother-in-law prevented them from depression. Our study is among the first to confirm that women have decreased depression but increased suicidal ideation at early postpartum, and a causal relationship between them, which are worthy of public attention. Potential protective (marital satisfaction, being first-time mother, and harmony with mother-in-law) or risk factors (miscarriage experiences and self-esteem) of maternal depression and suicidal ideation are identified at perinatal stages. This offers reliable guidance for clinical practice of health care. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can have numerous adverse growth, structural and neurodevelopmental consequences for the developing fetus. This spectrum of disabilities has been termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The most severe condition in this continuum of disability is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by a distinctive pattern of facial anomalies, growth retardation and developmental abnormalities of the central nervous system that often include mental retardation. Children with FASD who manifest some, but not all, of the features of FAS can be further categorized as having partial fetal alcohol syndrome (PFAS), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) or alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Specific structural birth defects (e.g. malformations of the heart, kidneys and/or musculoskeletal system) are the hallmark of ARBD in a child with normal growth and development; whereas, ARND comprises a specific pattern of disordered behavior and development among alcohol exposed children with normal growth and structural development. In addiction medicine, some evidence indicates that prenatal alcohol exposure can increase the risk for behavioral disorders, including depression and negative self-esteem in the offspring of alcoholic women. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure may result in long-term neurocognitive disorders involving problems with executive functioning, higher level language deficits and behavioral disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize what recently has been reported regarding specific criteria for defining and diagnosing the conditions within the overarching term FASD. Such criteria allow the continuum of FASD to be more readily diagnosed by practicing pediatricians, thereby leading to earlier intervention and amelioration of related medical and behavioral disorders.},

Women giving birth to term babies over a 6-month period, completed an Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) and a Rosenberg self-esteem scale in hospital, at 6 weeks postpartum and an EPDS only at 6 months postpartum. A total of 235 women participated in the study of which 222 (95\%) returned their questionnaire at 6 weeks postpartum and 192 (82\%) at 6 months postpartum. Characteristics of the women and their pregnancy outcome are presented. The EPDS identified a depressed mood in 9\% of women in hospital and at 6 weeks postpartum (95\% CI 5.3\%-12.8\%). At 6 months this had increased to 10\% (95\% CI 7.8\%-12.2\%). Postnatal depression was significantly correlated with low self-esteem in hospital and at 6 weeks postpartum.

Methods: From June 2010 to October 2012, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 antenatal care clinics in Belgium. Consenting pregnant women were asked to complete a questionnaire on socio-demographics, psychosocial health and violence in a separate room. Overall, 2586 women were invited to participate and we were able to use data from 1894 women (73.2\%) for analysis. Ethical clearance was obtained in all participating hospitals. Results: We found a significant correlation between IPV and poor psychosocial health: within the group of women who reported IPV, 53.2\% (n = 118) had poor psychosocial health, as compared to 21\% (n = 286) in the group of women who did not report IPV (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Lower psychosocial health scores were associated with increased odds of reporting IPV (aOR 1.55; 95\% CI 1.39-1.72), with adjustments made for the language in which the questionnaire was filled out, civil/marital status, education and age. In other words, a decrease of 10 points on the psychosocial health scale (total of 140) increased the odds of reporting IPV by 55\%. When accounting for the 6 psychosocial health subscales, the analysis revealed that all subscales (depression, anxiety, self-esteem, mastery, worry and stress) are strongly correlated to reporting IPV. However, when accounting for all subscales simultaneously in a logistic regression model, only depression (aOR 0.87; 95\% CI 0.84-0.91) and stress (aOR 0.85; 95\% CI 0.77-095) remained significantly associated with IPV. The association between overall psychosocial health and IPV remained significant after adjusting for socio-demographic status. Conclusion: Our research corroborated that IPV and psychosocial health are strongly associated. Due to the limitations of our study design, we believe that future research is needed to deepen understanding of the multitude of factors involved in the complex interactions between IPV and psychosocial health. \textcopyright{} 2015 Van Parys et al.},

  abstract = {Background Antepartum depressive symptoms (ADS) are highly prevalent and may affect the mother and child. Cognitive-behavioural therapy and interpersonal therapy are effective psychological interventions for depression. However, low adherence and high attrition rates in studies of prevention and treatment of antepartum depression suggest that these approaches might not be entirely suitable for women with mild/moderate ADS. Considering the protective association between resilience and ADS, women with ADS might benefit more from interventions focusing on promotion of mental well-being and resilience. Aims We aimed to provide an overview of studies evaluating the effectiveness of antepartum resilience-enhancing interventions targeting the improvement of ante- and postpartum depressive symptoms. We also investigated whether these interventions improve resilience and resilience factors in the peripartum period. Method We conducted a systematic review, using PRISMA guidelines. Studies were eligible for inclusion when they utilised a randomised controlled trial or quasi-experimental design, studied pregnant women with ADS, and implemented psychological interventions that (a) aimed to reduce maternal ADS and/or prevent peripartum major depression, and (b) addressed one or more psychological resilience factors. Results Five of the six included cognitive-behavioural therapy interventions and all four mindfulness-based interventions were effective in reducing peripartum depressive symptoms and/or the incidence of depression. However, the methodological quality of most of the included studies was low to moderate. Only three studies assessed change in resilience factors. Conclusions Resilience-enhancing interventions might be beneficial for mental well-being of pregnant women with ADS, although more rigorously designed intervention studies are needed.

This investigation in vulnerable school-aged Ugandan children estimates relationships between children's well-being and their caregiver's anxiety, depression and social support. Methods: Perinatally HIV-infected, HIV-exposed uninfected and HIV-unexposed Ugandan children and their caregivers were enrolled. Perinatal HIV status was determined by 18 months of age using DNA-polymerase chain-reaction test; status was confirmed via HIV rapid diagnostic test when children were 6\textendash 18 years old. Five indicators of child well-being (distress, hopelessness, positive future orientation, esteem and quality of life (QOL)) and caregivers' socioemotional status (depressive symptoms, anxiety and social support) were measured using validated, culturally adapted and translated instruments. Categories based on tertiles of each caregiver psychosocial indicator were defined. Linear regression analyses estimated percent differences ({$\beta$}) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for child well-being in relation to caregiver's psychosocial status. Results: As per tertile increment, caregiver anxiety was associated with 2.7\% higher distress (95\%CI:0.2\%, 5.3\%) and lower self-esteem/QOL ({$\beta$} = -1.3\%/-2.6\%; 95\%CI: -5.0\%,-0.2\%) in their children. Child distress/hopelessness increased ({$\beta$} = 3.3\%/7.6\%; 95\%CI:0.4\%, 14.7\%) and self-esteem/QOL decreased 2.3\% ({$\beta$} = -2.3\%/-4.4\%; 95\%CI: -7.2\%, -1.3\%) as per tertile increment in caregiver depression. Higher caregiver social support was associated with lower distress and higher positive outlook ({$\beta$} = 3\%; 95\%CI:1.4\%, 4.5\%) in their children. HIV-infected/exposed children had most caregiver depression-related QOL deficit ({$\beta$} = -5.2\%/-6.8\%; 95\%CI: -12.4\%, -0.2\%) and HIV-unexposed children had most caregiver social support-related enhancements in positive outlook ({$\beta$}=4.5\%; 95\%CI:1.9\%, 7.1\%). Conclusions: Caregiver anxiety, depressive symptoms and low social support were associated with worse well-being in school-aged and adolescent children. Improvement of caregiver mental health and strengthening caregiver social support systems may be a viable strategy for improving well-being of vulnerable children and adolescents in this setting. \textcopyright{} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

  abstract = {Numerous health consequences of children's exposure to maternal smoking have been demonstrated, including increased rates of low birth weight, infant mortality, respiratory infections, asthma, and modest impairments of cognitive development. There is little evidence, however, linking maternal smoking and increased rates of children's behavior problems. Data from the population-based National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were used to investigate the possible association of maternal smoking and behavior problems among 2256 children aged 4 through 11 years. In multiple regression analyses the authors controlled for child's race, age, sex, birth weight, and chronic asthma; family structure, income, and divorce or separation in the prior 2 years; mother's education, intelligence, self-esteem, employment status, chronic disabling health conditions, and use of alcohol during pregnancy; and the quality of the home environment as assessed by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form to investigate the relationship between maternal smoking and children's behavior problems. The measure of maternal smoking status reflected two levels of smoking intensity (less than a pack per day and a pack or more per day) for each of three different categories of children's exposure: prenatal only (mother smoked only during pregnancy), passive only (mother smoked only after pregnancy), and prenatal plus passive exposure (mother smoked both during and after pregnancy). Measures of children's behavior problems included the overall score on a 32-item parent-reported child Behavior Problem Index (BPI), scores on the BPI's six subscales, and rates of extreme scores on the BPI. Increased rates of children's behavior problems were found to be independently associated with all three categories of exposure to maternal cigarette smoke, with evidence suggesting a dose-response relationship. For example, among children whose mothers smoked both during and after pregnancy, there were 1.17 additional problems independently associated with smoking less than a pack per day (P = .0007) and 2.04 additional problems associated with smoking a pack or more per day (P = .0001). The odds ratio for extreme behavior problem scores for this category of exposure was 1.41 if the mother smoked less than a pack per day (P = .01) and 1.54 if she smoked a pack or more per day (P = .02). These data provide evidence suggesting that increased behavior problems of children should be added to the growing list of adverse child health conditions associated with children's prenatal and passive exposure to maternal smoking.},

Methods: African American adolescent females (n = 522) completed a survey that assessed body image using a 7-item scale ({$\alpha$} = 0.71) and a face-to-face interview that assessed sexual behaviors. Results: In logistic regression analyses, controlling for depression, self-esteem and body mass index (BMI), adolescents who were more dissatisfied with their body image were more likely to fear abandonment as a result of negotiating condom use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.3, p = 0.02), more likely to perceive that they had fewer options for sexual partners (AOR = 2.4, p = 0.001), more likely to perceive themselves as having limited control in their sexual relationships (AOR = 2.0, p = 0.002), and more likely to worry about acquiring HIV(AOR = 1.5, p = 0.04). There was an association between having a greater dissatisfaction with one's body image and never using condoms during sexual intercourse in the past 30 days (AOR = 1.6, p = 0.04) and more likely to engage in unprotected vaginal sex in the prior 6 months (AOR = 1.6, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Prior research has demonstrated an association between African American women's body image and greater obesity risk, lower self-esteem, and greater depression. The present study has shown an association between body image dissatisfaction and a range of sexual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Women who are more dissatisfied with their body image may be at greater risk for unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV infection. \textcopyright{} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Methods: Using a prospective cohort study design, data on women's depression and its influencing factors were collected at 20, 28, and 36 weeks of pregnancy and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postpartum. The participants were 219 women and 181 spouses during pregnancy; and 183 mothers and 130 spouses after childbirth. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and influencing factors were measured by the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised, parity, and spousal depression. Results: The prevalence of maternal depression was 10.5\% to 21.5\% before birth, and it was 22.4\% to 32.8\% postpartum. The prevalence slightly decreased during the prenatal period but peaked at 2 weeks postpartum. Antenatal depression was influenced by low socioeconomic status, lower self-esteem, having experienced prenatal depression, having experienced prenatal anxiety, a previous history of depression, lower social support, lower marital satisfaction, and higher life stress. The factors influencing postpartum depression were lower self-esteem, having experienced prenatal depression, having experienced prenatal anxiety, lower social support, lower marital satisfaction, and higher life stress, as well as infant temperament and maternal blues. Parity and spousal depression had no impacts. Conclusion: The prevalence and influencing factors of maternal depression changed over time. Nurses need to screen women accordingly during the perinatal period and should provide education or counseling to prevent depression and promote adjustment to parenthood. \textcopyright{} 2021 Korean Society of Women Health Nursing.},

All participants underwent psychosocial assessment, with the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale being used for the evaluation of postnatal depression. Results: The overall prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 11.3\%, and the most common form of domestic violence was psychologic abuse. The follow-up interviews showed a higher prevalence of postnatal depression among women who had been abused during pregnancy (25.1\%) than among those who had not (6.0\%). Psychologic abuse during pregnancy, an unexpected pregnancy, an attitude of acceptance toward violence, and concern over the newborn's health were related with postnatal depression. Conclusion: Domestic violence during pregnancy and related factors contributed to postnatal depression in a population of Chinese women.

Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the factors related to suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability. The prevalence rates of suicidal ideation and suicide acceptability among the sampled females are 22.5\% and 3.8\%, respectively. Education, depression, social support, hopelessness, and negative life events were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Ethnicity, education, abortion, and depression were significantly associated with suicide acceptability. There is statistical difference between suicide ideation and acceptability. The results indicate that mental disorder remains a major risk factor of suicidal ideation.
