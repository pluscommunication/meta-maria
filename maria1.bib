Abstract = {Research Question/Issue This paper investigates the relationship between
   the use of external assurance for testing integrated reports (ESG
   assurance) and firm-level governance features: the board of directors,
   the audit and/or risk committee, and the internal audit department. Data
   are collected from South Africa where integrated reporting and corporate
   governance practices are mature and listed companies have had more time
   to implement ESG assurance than in other countries. Research
   Findings/Insights Monitoring attributes of boards of directors promotes
   the use of ESG assurance which provide both limited (moderate) and
   reasonable (high) assurance. The monitoring attributes of the audit and
   risk committees limit the use of limited assurance but are associated
   with the greater use of reasonable assurance. In contrast, internal
   audit functions are not affecting the use of ESG assurance.
   Theoretical/Academic Implications The study provides one of the first
   accounts of how firm-level governance promotes or reduces the use of
   external assurance in an integrated reporting context. The research also
   frames ESG assurance as part of the broader corporate governance
   machinery rather than seeing assurance and governance as separate
   issues. Practitioner/Policy Implications Overall, the findings suggest
   that ESG assurance is an important part of a combined assurance model.
   As those charged with governance become more proactive in ensuring the
   credibility of their organizations' corporate reports, they not only
   choose to appoint an external assuror but also rely on more extensive
   testing designed to provide higher levels of assurance.},

Month = {2023 MAY 9},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study examines the effects of corporate governance
   mechanisms on voluntary corporate carbon disclosure in Bangladeshi
   firms.Design/methodology/approachTo investigate the association between
   corporate governance mechanisms and corporate carbon disclosures, this
   study employs ordinary least square (OLS) methods. To mitigate the
   potential endogeneity concerns, the authors also introduce firm fixed
   effect (FE) and random effect (RE). Primarily, the study sample includes
   250 firm-year observations over the period 2015-2019 for listed
   companies on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) in Bangladesh. Subsequently,
   corporate governance mechanisms that influence voluntary carbon
   disclosure were examined using both univariate and OLS
   models.FindingsThe findings of this study suggest that firms with a
   larger board size and more independent directors have a positive impact
   on the firm's intensity to disclose carbon-related information. However,
   no evidence has been found of the existence of an environmental
   committee, and the presence of female directors on the board tends to be
   associated with a higher level of voluntary corporate carbon
   disclosure.Originality/valueThe study offers necessary evidence of the
   determinants of corporate carbon disclosures, which will be useful for
   managers, senior executives, policymakers and regulatory bodies. To
   improve corporate governance practices and formulate separate sets of
   regulations and reporting criteria, disclosing extensive and holistic
   carbon-related information obligatory. Further, the outcomes of this
   study based on Bangladeshi firms can be comprehensive for other
   developing countries to take precautions to tackle the effect of global
   climate change.},

Abstract = {In the article, we provide an original linkage between the corporate
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating and the cost of
   internal control system (ICSC) stemmed from two closely related
   frameworks: the 2017 CoSO Framework, which calls to strengthen internal
   control systems to integrate ESG issues, and the EU directive on
   nonfinancial reporting (2014/95/EU) that entered into force in 2017.
   Thus, we evaluate both introductions showing ESG integration in the
   internal control activities. We cover firms listed on Milan Exchange
   from 2016 to 2019, providing a thorough analysis with robustness tests.
   The findings imply that firms should consider both ESG rating and the
   internal control system cost as strategic corporate tools for value
   enhancement; therefore, companies should allocate the resources
   appropriately to internal control activities to incorporate ESG issues
   and create value since internal control provides the first assurance for
   ESG integration. The limitations of this study pave the way for further
   research directions; incorporating the new amendment of the EU directive
   on nonfinancial disclosure, allowing for a better valuation creation
   assessment; and whether there is a substitution between sustainability
   performance and other corporate issues such as taxes and marketing
   expenditure.},

   an international sample, we show that board diversity, the existence of

   independence decreases it. The findings further suggest that several
   configurations of these mechanisms complement each other in improving
   the credibility of nonfinancial disclosure through assurance. However,
   other configurations do not work in tandem, supporting the existence of
   substitution effects. Overall, bundling various governance mechanisms

Abstract = {The current study examines the relationship between corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) disclosures, media announcements of CSR awards and
   a firm's cost of debt in Malaysia. The sample consists of 104 Malaysian
   publicly listed companies belonging to the Edge Billion Ringgit Club
   between 2009 to 2015. The study uses panel data regression analysis and
   the ordinary least squares estimation method. The results find that the
   interaction between CSR disclosures and winning awards for a company's
   CSR initiatives and practices lowers the cost of debt. Our study
   concludes that, when a company discloses more information on its CSR
   initiatives and practices, it reduces the cost of debt. Thus, we argue
   that CSR disclosures and awards can act as proxies for branding listed
   firms, making them more marketable and allowing them to negotiate better
   debt contracts. However, the study shows that politically connected
   companies have a higher debt cost than non-politically connected firms.
   Furthermore, our results indicate that smaller boards are effective, but
   audit committees are not effective in monitoring the board of directors

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {901-920},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to assess the informativeness of carbon emission data
   for the stock markets and the mediating role played by financial
   analysts and the quality of the governance on this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Relying on structural equation modelling, the authors assess the
   relation between embedded CO2 disclosure or CO2 emissions disclosure and
   the stock market valuation (Tobin Q), considering the mediating roles
   played by financial analysts (external monitoring) and corporate
   governance (internal monitoring).
   Findings
   Results based on a sample of North American firms in the oil and gas
   industry are the following. The disclosure of embedded CO2 is negatively
   associated with a firm's market value, but this association is mediated
   by analyst following and corporate governance. The disclosure of yearly
   CO2 emissions is also negatively related to stock market value, while
   corporate governance mediates this negative impact, and analysts
   following does not. Considering that yearly CO2 emissions represent
   short-term environmental risks, whereas embedded CO2 represents
   long-term environmental risks, it appears important to consider embedded
   CO2 when studying the impact of carbon disclosure on firm value. The
   authors also show that a firm's environmental performance (measured by
   Carbon Disclosure Project - CDP) is positively associated with two
   mediating variables (i.e. analyst following and corporate governance).
   Originality/value
   The study results suggest that CO2 emissions information is less
   relevant than embedded CO2 in attracting financial analysts when they
   are assessing a firm's value because it represents short-term
   environmental risks, whereas embedded CO2 represents long-term
   environmental risks. Therefore, the authors consider important to
   include embedded CO2 when studying the impact of environmental
   disclosure on a firm's value.},

Title = {Corporate social responsibility and future bankruptcy},
Journal = {MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the cross-sectional differences
   on the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and
   future bankruptcy along the dimensions of political connection and
   corporate governance strength. This study intends to provide evidence on
   the tangible benefits for firms to invest in social capital of CSR
   activities and offer insights on what firms may benefit more from CSR
   expenditure. Design/methodology/approach Running a logistic regression
   on the determinants of bankruptcy model after controlling for financial
   stress factors based on prior literature, this study examines the
   moderating effect of political connection and corporate governance on
   the association between corporate social responsibility and future
   bankruptcy. Findings Current study documents that the negative
   association between corporate social responsibility and future
   bankruptcy is only significant for politically connected firms, but
   insignificant for non-politically connected firms. Specifically, the
   authors find that one standard deviation increase of CSR expenditure
   significantly reduces the propensity of future bankruptcy by 53.20\% for
   politically-connected firms. Conversely, the negative relation between
   CSR only exits for firms with weak corporate governance but do not exit
   for firms with strong corporate governance. Research
   limitations/implications Current study provides evidence on the tangible
   benefits for firms to invest in social capital of CSR activities and
   offers additional insights on what firms may benefit more from CSR
   expenditure. Originality/value Current study extends the research to
   examine the cross-sectional variations in the negative association
   between CSR performance and the propensity of bankruptcy. The positive
   moderating effect of political connection on CSR and bankruptcy suggests
   that political connection and CSR are complements in reducing the
   propensity of future bankruptcy. A more pronounced negative association
   between CSR and bankruptcy for firms with weaker governance suggests

Title = {Do nonprofessional investors value the assurance of integrated reports?
   Exploratory evidence},

Abstract = {Using an experimental design, this explorative study provides unique
   empirical evidence of the effects of an integrated reporting assurance
   (IRA) on nonprofessional investors' (NPIs) financial decision-making in
   a laboratory experiment. For this purpose, two independent experiments
   were carried out, one relying on a sample of Master's students, and one
   focusing on managers of large corporations. In line with our agency
   theoretical reasoning, we find that students value an IRA positively,
   evidenced through significantly higher investments, while, contrary to
   expectations, an IRA has the opposite effect for managers. The results
   reveal that, dependent on the empirical model, an IRA has either no, or
   even an investment decreasing, impact on executives. In order to assess
   the sense-making process underlying this conundrum, subsequent
   interviews with the managers were carried out which revealed three
   dimensions that shape practitioners' critical attitudes towards
   assurance engagements. First, managers expressed a general disbelief in
   the decision usefulness of integrated reporting (IR) to
   (nonprofessional) investors. Second, interlocutors referred to negative
   practical experiences with audit and assurance engagements and had
   technical doubts specific to IRA. Third, managers voiced emotional
   caveats regarding the audit and assurance profession. These findings
   indicate a prevailing divergence between the extolled theoretical
   contribution of an IRA to report credibility and its actual nature in
   practice. In the further course of the investigation, we also find that
   the assurance provider (Big 4 auditor versus specialized consultant)
   does not affect investment decisions, but that a higher assurance level
   leverages investments among students. The results of this study add to
   the growing, albeit still small, IRA research body and deliver valuable
   insights for research, regulators, and practice. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to identify the changes in the share of large
   public interest entities (PIEs) in European Union (EU) Member States
   providing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reporting prior to (2017)
   and after (2019) the implementation of Directive 2014/95/EU and the
   factors that influence their decisions to provide SDG reporting in 2019.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors use the multilevel theory of
   social change in organizations as the theoretical background. The sample
   consists of 341 PIEs based in the EU Member States, for which reports
   published in 2017 and 2019 are available in the global reporting
   initiative sustainability disclosure database. The authors analyzed the
   data using the statistical significance test of equal proportions and
   the logistic regression model. Findings The study findings allow to
   identify a significant positive change in the share of companies
   providing a reference to SDGs in 2019 compared with 2017. The research
   confirms that companies' engagement in United Nations Global Compact and
   previous experience in sustainability reporting positively influences
   the decision to report on SDGs in 2019. Contrary to the expectations,
   industry, size, SDG implementation score, future orientation of
   government and corporate governance score do not seem to be relevant
   factors influencing PIEs' disclosures. Originality/value The paper adds
   to the understanding of the differences in SDG reporting within the EU,
   which is seen as a frontrunner in implementing the 2030 Agenda and the
   SDGs.},

Pages = {58-75},
Abstract = {Securities commissions regularly review corporate reports, and if the
   review reveals a possible deficiency- such as a potential accounting
   error- or requires further clarifications, they send the company a
   comment letter (CL), including a request for providing written responses
   and relative additional information. Current study aims to examine
   whether and how corporate social responsibility (CSR) affects CLs. This
   empirical study is based on a sample of 437 Iranian firm year
   observations from 2011 to 2017. Results show that firms with more CSR
   are less likely to receive CL, that more CSR does not influence the
   association of managerial misbehavior and CLs, and that the negative
   association between CSR and CLs is stronger among firms facing higher
   environmental information asymmetry and firms having higher corporate
   governance quality. Collectively, this paper contributes to the
   literature by providing new evidence on the beneficial effect of CSR in
   the context of CLs. (C) 2022 ASEPUC. Published by EDITUM - Universidad

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING AUDITING AND TAXATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study examines the adoption of mandatory corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) regulation in the United Kingdom (UK).
   Specifically, we investigate whether adopting new CSR regulations
   impacts the quality of firms' CSR reporting and explore whether that
   quality depends on a firms' characteristics. Our empirical results
   suggest that the UK's mandatory CSR reporting regulation significantly
   enhances CSR reporting quality. We further find that firms'
   characteristics, particularly corporate governance and firm size,
   improve mandatory CSR reporting quality. Our results are robust to the
   use of an alternative proxy of CSR quality assessment and testing for
   endogeneity. These findings suggest that committing to CSR can
   substantially benefit stakeholders, who will be better informed
   regarding the firms' CSR performance through improved reporting quality.
   This factor can influence investors' beliefs and market valuations,
   which may subsequently guide firms' investment decisions. (C) 2021

Abstract = {This paper examines whether firms that engage in corporate social
   responsibility activities (CSR firms) manage reported cash flows from
   operations (CFO) when they have strong credit market incentives. We find
   that CSR firms near financial distress and those having a long-term
   credit rating near the investment/non-investment grade cutoff are more
   likely to inflate reported CFO, compared to all other firms. We also
   find evidence that CSR firms with these credit market incentives appear
   to resort mainly to classification rather than timing as a tool for
   managing CFO. Further, we find that the degree of CFO management
   performed by those CSR firms is more pronounced under weaker corporate
   governance. Overall, our findings suggest that CSR firms with stronger
   credit market incentives are more likely to manage CFO, and that such
   CFO management behavior is likely to be implemented at the expense of
   shareholders' interest.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The study analysed the asymmetry in the disclosure of environmental
   criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard based on
   financial and non-financial information in 37 companies in 19
   sub-sectors of the Colombian economy that were assessed by MERCO
   (Business Monitor of Corporate Reputation) in 2017 and 2018 in terms of
   corporate reputation, responsibility, and corporate governance. It is
   based on the theories of agency, stakeholders, and legitimacy, whereby
   six hypotheses were postulated. The indicators of environmental criteria
   were retrieved from the website and sustainability reports of each
   company, using a dichotomous approach for collecting information on
   environmental activities. The hypotheses were contrasted with a binary
   choice and panel data models. The results showed that increasing quality
   and transparency in voluntarily disclosed information decreases its
   asymmetry, thereby meeting the information needs of stakeholders,
   providing confidence, and strengthening corporate social responsibility
   (CSR) activities. In addition, the most indebted and largest companies
   disclose less information on environmental activities, in contrast to
   companies with higher solvency. Overall, the study contributed with the
   calculation of an asymmetry ratio with the MERCO indicators and the use
   of the insolvency risk variable as an explanatory variable for
   disclosure. Additionally, it contributed to the field of study of CSR
   from the Latin American context.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of corporate environmental, social and
   governance (ESG) disclosure on cash holdings, specifically during
   various stages of the firm life cycle of S\&P 1500 indexed firms. Using
   a sample of 9811 firm-year observations from 2006 to 2015, we document a
   significantly negative relation between ESG disclosure and cash holdings
   in the introduction, growth and shake-out/decline stages, and those
   lower cash holdings are associated with higher firm performance and a
   positive value of cash. Our findings are robust to alternative
   econometric specifications, alternative measures, additional control
   variables, propensity score matching and the use of an instrumental
   variable approach. Overall, our study offers useful insights into the
   global debate on ESG.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) orientation and textual at-tributes of financial
   disclosures. Using a large U.S. sample from 1999 to 2017, we find that
   firms with high CSR orientation provide more readable disclosures and
   use a less ambiguous tone in their annual reports. These findings are
   consistent with the notion that managers in CSR-conscious firms adhere
   to high ethical standards and commit to improving the transparency of
   their firms' financial disclosures. Our results are robust to
   alter-native measures of readability and CSR performance, potential
   endogeneity, and sampling methods. Moreover, in a cross-sectional
   analysis, we show that the impact of CSR on corporate readability/tone
   ambiguity is more pronounced for firms with weak corporate governance.
   Overall, the results suggest that CSR serves as a substitute for
   traditional corporate governance mechanisms to ensure transparent
   disclosure.},

Abstract = {Management incentives for engaging and excelling in corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) performance is an important theme as business
   sustainability gains momentum. We examine the role of tournament
   incentives, which are created by competition among non-CEO (chief
   executive officer) senior executives (vice presidents {[}VPs]) for
   promotion to the CEO position, in firms' CSR performance. Using a sample
   of U.S. Standard \& Poor (S\&P) 1500 firms from 1993 to 2014, we find
   that tournament incentives proxied by pay gaps between CEOs and VPs are
   negatively associated with CSR performance, suggesting that competition
   for promotion could be detrimental for CSR performance. We further show
   that such association is more pronounced when the perceived probability
   of promotion increases prior to CEO turnover. This article provides
   policy, practical, and education implications and contribute to the
   literature on the integration of CSR into the business culture and

Abstract = {Purpose In this paper, the author utilizes a unique hand-collected
   dataset of workplace lawsuits, violations and allegations to test the
   relation between employee mistreatment and information asymmetry.
   Design/methodology/approach The author tests the impact of employee
   treatment on firms' information environment by utilizing the S\&P 1500
   firms of 17,663 firm-year observations, which include 2,992 unique firms
   and 5,987 unique CEOs between 2000 and 2016. These methods include panel
   fixed effects, as well as alternative measures of information asymmetry,
   event study and matched samples for further robustness tests. Findings
   The author finds that employee disputes exacerbate the information flow
   between insiders and outsiders. Further, the author reports that case
   characteristics, such as case outcome and case duration, aggravate that
   problem. The author documents that the positive relationship between
   employee mistreatment and information asymmetry is stronger for small
   firms and firms with smaller market power, as well as firms with a high
   level of equity risk. Originality/value This study is the first to
   investigate how employee relations influence a firm's information
   asymmetry. The author aims to contribute to the literature by studying
   (1) the relation between information asymmetry and employee
   mistreatment, (2) how firm characteristics affect the path from employee
   disputes to information asymmetry and (3) the influence of various other
   types of evidence of employee mistreatment beyond litigation on the
   information environment.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the initiatives that companies are promoting to curb
   climate change and the impacts resulting from these activities require
   the disclosure of relevant information that can be used by stakeholders
   in their decision-making processes. The objective of this work is to
   complement previous studies by analysing the effect and type of
   relationship that exists between internal and market corporate
   governance mechanisms. We theoretically argue that business transparency
   related to climate change is explained both by climate governance and by
   the coverage of the company by financial analysts and that there may be
   both a complementary and substitutive relationship between the two
   mechanisms. The results obtained on a global climate governance score
   show the existence of a substitutive relationship, but the
   individualised consideration of the components of this score suggests a
   potential divergent relationship.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Corporate social responsibility (CSR) research has recently begun to
   focus on the CSR performance of business groups, with the scope shifting
   from group members to business groups in general. This paper focuses on
   whether business groups with centralized decision rights tend to
   disclose more CSR information and investigates the heterogeneous effect
   of the number of subsidiaries. Using a dataset for listed groups in
   China from 2010 to 2020, our empirical test discovered that centralized
   decision rights could promote group CSR disclosure. For groups with many
   subsidiaries, centralization makes a more significant contribution to
   promoting CSR disclosure. The mechanism test revealed that this positive
   relationship between centralization and disclosure relies on efficient
   internal capital market allocation, a reduction in rent-seeking behavior
   of subsidiaries, and reputational concerns. Furthermore, we observed
   that the centralized decision rights influence on disclosure varies
   across different aspects of CSR, with a negative impact on ``Social
   Contribution{''} and a positive impact on ``Shareholder
   Responsibility{''}, ``Employee Responsibility{''}, ``Supplier, Customer,
   and Consumer Responsibility{''} and ``Environmental Responsibility{''}.
   Centralized decision rights promote more CSR disclosures with voluntary
   disclosures, while regulatory disclosures have no significant effect. We
   research the allocation of decision rights and group CSR disclosure.},

Abstract = {Using data on Chinese A-share listed firms from 2008 to 2017, we explore
   how corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance is affected by
   managerial short-termism and what factors influence the association
   between the two. First, by employing text analysis in conjunction with
   machine learning, we construct a new managerial short-termism indicator.
   Using panel fixed models, we find that managerial short-termism has an
   adverse impact on CSR performance, and the results are consistent in a
   series of robustness checks. The heterogeneous test results show that
   the negative effect is significant only for firms with lower internal
   corporate governance, for firms in less competitive industries, for
   firms with less analyst attention, and for state-owned enterprises
   (SOEs). Additionally, a better institutional environment weakens the
   negative impact of managerial short-termism on CSR performance. The
   findings shed light on policy implications for emerging countries.},

Abstract = {The disclosure of corporate social responsibility (CSR) information has
   been attracting increasing attention from practitioners and researchers.
   This paper examines whether CSR disclosure affects stock price
   informativeness (SPI) in China by utilizing a propensity score matching
   and difference-in-difference approach. After the introduction of
   mandatory CSR disclosure regulation in China, we find that firms' SPI
   decreased significantly, while information asymmetry between investors
   and managers increased significantly. This result is supported by a
   battery of robustness tests. We also find evidence that a well-developed
   corporate governance mechanism and incremental information as reflected
   by the reliability and certainty of the narratives of CSR reports
   mitigate the negative relation between mandatory disclosure and SPI.
   Additional analysis indicates that SPI reduction applies mainly to firms
   under a mandatory CSR program rather than firms that voluntarily
   disclosed CSR before 2008.},

Title = {A survey on ESG: investors, institutions and firms},
Journal = {CHINA FINANCE REVIEW INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 6},
Abstract = {Purpose - Over the past two decades, the topics of Environmental, Social
   and Corporate Governance (ESG) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
   have attracted an increasing amount of interest, reflecting a growing
   sensitivity of investors and corporations towards environmental, social
   and governance issues. Design/methodology/approach - This survey offers
   an overview of the academic literature on ESG/CSR through the lens of
   investors, institutions and firms. We first discuss the definitions of
   ESG and CSR and their relationship to each other.Findings - We next
   describe how ESG is measured and note problems with the measurement of
   and quality of ESG data and discrepancies between different measures of
   ESG. We then turn our attention to investors, examining what types of
   investors invest in ESG and the role of institutional investors in ESG.
   From the firm's perspective, we discuss why firms themselves conduct
   ESG. We also summarize the literature on the impact of ESG on firms: how
   ESG affects firms' financing, disclosure and reporting activities and
   firm performance. Finally, we describe other consequences of the focus
   of ESG and CSR on firms and investors. Originality/value - This survey
   offers an overview of the academic literature on ESG/CSR through the
   lens of investors, institutions and firms.},

Title = {Should risk-averse investors target the portfolios of socially
   responsible companies?},
Journal = {OECONOMIA COPERNICANA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {439-474},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research background: Companies are required to implement Corporate
   Social Responsibility (CSR) policies to mitigate the adverse social and
   environmental effects of their activities and gain legitimacy in the
   eyes of society. Sustainability initiatives are costly for companies
   but, at the same time, they are important value-creation drivers. Retail
   and institutional investors ate increasingly choosing portfolios based
   on CSR performance. However. the relationship between CSR and market
   beta has hardly been studied at all in the literature, and no direct
   comparison of the U.S. and European markets has been conducted.
   Purpose of the article: The two fundamental variables that define an
   investment are return and risk, and the appropriate risk-return
   combination depends on the profile of the investors. This research aims
   to analyze the relationship between CSR and market risk, understood as
   price volatility and measured by market beta in the U.S. and European
   markets.
   Methods: Companies listed in the S\&P 500 and Euro Stoxx 300 indexes
   from 2015 to 2019 were examined using OLS regressions with instrumental
   variables (IV) and fixed effects panel data.
   Findings \& value added: The results show that those companies with
   higher CSR have betas below the market index in the U.S. market as well
   as lower volatility, and are, therefore, more appropriate choices for
   risk-averse investors. However, this relationship was not confirmed in
   the European market. This difference may be justified by two reasons: 1)
   The non-adherence of the United States to the Kyoto Protocol, resulting
   in less strict legal regulations than in Europe; 2) In the U.S. market,
   betas are more aggressive, while in the European market they are more
   defensive, with little margin for reduction. This research contributes
   to the current state of knowledge by providing empirical evidence that
   social, environmental, and corporate governance sustainability practices
   reduce stock volatility in the U.S. capital market, which is highly
   relevant for private and institutional investors who make their
   investments based on moral criteria. The results are current and
   reliable since they cover a broad and recent period for two of the most
   important stock market indexes.},

Title = {Country-Level Institutions and Transparency of Directors' Information
   Disclosure: The Role of the Labor Market},
Journal = {EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 7},
Abstract = {This study investigates whether country-level institutions related to
   the labor market affect firms' disclosure of information about their
   directors. Our findings, based on a sample of public companies domiciled
   in 46 countries, show that the level of disclosure of directors'
   information, particularly information on their remuneration, is lower
   for firms in countries with better developed labor markets. We further
   find that in countries with more stringent labor regulations, firms are
   less likely to disclose both directors' remuneration and biographical
   information. Firms in countries with better labor systems (e.g. greater
   mobility in the labor market and more effective social dialogue) make
   more such disclosures. Overall, our findings suggest that better
   developed country-level institutions related to the labor market
   disincentivize firms from disclosing information about directors.
   However, different types of country-level institutions have different
   impacts on firms' incentives to make such disclosures. Our study
   provides valuable insights into how labor market development affects the
   alignment of boards' incentives with those of stakeholders such as
   employees and how external pressure from employees affects a firm's
   strategic actions regarding disclosing directors' information.},

Title = {Mandatory CSR disclosure and CEO pay performance sensitivity in China:
   evidence from a quasi-natural experiment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL FINANCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 30},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to empirically examine the impact of mandatory
   CSR disclosure on the CEO pay performance
   sensitivity.Design/methodology/approachUsing the mandatory requirement
   of CSR disclosure as an exogenous shock, the authors compare the changes
   in CEO pay performance sensitivity for treatment firms with control
   firms through a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach.FindingsThe
   authors find that mandatory CSR disclosure enhances CEO pay performance
   sensitivity. The results also show that monitoring CEO power is a
   conduit through which mandatory CSR disclosure affects CEO pay
   performance sensitivity. The positive impact is more profound in firms
   with a powerful CEO, i.e. one who is politically well-connected, holds
   dual roles as both CEO and Chairman, and/or has had a long tenure.
   Furthermore, the increased CEO pay performance sensitivity after the
   mandate is prominent among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) only.Practical
   implicationsThe findings of this paper have implications for other
   economies with similar institutional backgrounds as China. Although the
   mandatory CSR disclosure does not require firms to spend on CSR
   investment, the mandatory CSR disclosure alters firm behaviour, and
   mitigates agency problems.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to the
   studies on the impact of CSR disclosure on firms' behaviour. To the
   authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of
   mandatory CSR disclosure on CEO pay performance sensitivity using the
   quasi-natural experiment settings.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of articles on the topic of
   non-financial information (NFI) reporting. The exponential growth over
   the last decade (90\% of the articles were published in the last 10
   years) indicates the relevance of the topic, but little is known about
   the structure and extent of research in this academic field. The purpose
   of this article is to provide a structured and up-to-date picture of the
   state of the art on the topic. We analyse the most relevant articles,
   authors, journals, countries and organizations. The analysis includes
   3113 articles, collected from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection
   from 1970 -when the first two articles on the topic were published- to
   2019. The software VOSviewer was used to graphically display the data.
   We identified and described a total of six research lines in the
   literature: determinants, essence, reports, integrated reporting,
   environment, and consequences of reporting. These research lines are
   analysed and gaps for future research are identified. We also comment on
   the implications of the strong collaboration networks found within Arab,
   European and Asian countries. This study is of great interest because it
   provides researchers with a map of the field, improving their
   understanding of the interconnection between aspects within the topic.
   It also enables researchers to better position their studies and to
   identify new streams of research.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine the impacts of environmental, social
   and governance (ESG) disclosure and financial reporting quality (FRQ) on
   investment efficiency. Design/methodology/approach Several econometric
   models have been applied to estimate the impacts of ESG disclosure and
   FRQ on investment efficiency, using the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a
   sample in 2010-2019. Estimations considered subsamples of
   underinvestment, overinvestment and low and high FRQ values. Findings
   Empirical results show a positive relationship between ESG disclosure,
   FRQ and investment efficiency, and that this relationship is more
   important in the underinvestment and high FRQ sub-samples. Results
   suggest that ESG disclosure improves transparency, mitigates information
   asymmetry and enhances investment efficiency. Research
   limitations/implications The findings could help UAE regulators
   incorporate ESG information into reporting and implement effective
   mechanisms to increase the extent of ESG information to improve
   investment efficiency. This study only examined UAE traded companies.
   Future research should investigate other factors influencing investment
   efficiency and conduct comparative studies across Gulf Cooperation
   Council countries. Social implications This study reveals the
   significant positive impact of ESG disclosure and FRQ on investment
   efficiency. These findings will help companies optimize their ESG
   information disclosure, improve the quality of their financial reports
   and comply with ESG standards. The study aims to develop knowledge that
   will not only benefit companies regarding the potential impact of ESG
   disclosure but also help national and international society create a
   better social environment and reduce climate change. Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to
   examine the relationship between ESG disclosure, FRQ and corporate
   investment efficiency. The research contributes to understanding the
   financial impacts of ESG disclosure and FRQ and supports regulators'
   efforts to enforce ESG disclosure and improve FRQ.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the literature on environmental, social, and
   governance (ESG) disclosure by applying a bibliometric analysis of
   documents published in the Scopus database. The bibliometric analysis
   allows researchers to highlight the theoretical foundations of a
   specific research field, identify the main findings of previous studies,
   and determine future research ideas. This analysis was based on
   bibliometric authors' citation analysis, bibliometric papers'
   co-citation analysis, bibliometric references' co-citation analysis,
   bibliometric journals' co-citation analysis, co-occurrence keywords
   cartography analysis, trend and evolution analyses of ESG disclosure
   publications over the years, and qualitative content analysis. This
   study reviews 161 documents on ESG disclosure published in the Scopus
   database. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer, evolution
   analysis was performed using CiteSpace, and content analysis was
   performed using Wordstat. The study identified four major clusters:
   corporate social responsibility, corporate strategy, financial
   performance, and environmental economics. It also highlights the
   increasing number of citations and documents related to ESG disclosures.
   In addition, the journal `Business Strategy and the Environment'
   significantly contributes to the ESG disclosure research field in terms
   of number of papers and citations. Additionally, this study highlights
   various future research opportunities in this field. The findings of
   this study have practical implications for ESG disclosure, such as the
   impact of integrating ESG into a company's business strategy on
   corporate and financial policies. This study is the only one to review
   key topics on ESG disclosure that can be largely used for ESG practices.
   This study provides an overview of how the literature on ESG disclosure
   has developed, as well as a summary of the most influential authors
   along with countries, organizations, and journal sources. This offers
   the opportunity for future research to focus on this topic.},

Abstract = {This paper goes beyond the relationship between a bank ESG performance
   (ESGP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). Here, the link between
   ESG factors and financial benchmarks is analysed to verify whether banks
   may find in the market reaction sufficient stimuli (higher CFP) to adopt
   ESG conduct spontaneously. Using panel estimation methods on European
   banks listed in STOXX Europe 600, between 2008 and 2019, this paper
   tests the relationship between ESGP and CFP considering different
   dimensions of financial performance at once, both accounted-based (ROA
   and ROE) and market-based (Capitalisation to Book Value, Tobin's Q).
   Besides, we employ VBM (EVA Spread) not previously considered. The main
   findings support the current approach of banking authorities, focusing
   on bank ESG risks, more than ESG opportunities, in order to ``force{''}
   banks into adopting a new ESG business model, at this early stage of
   transition to sustainability.},
