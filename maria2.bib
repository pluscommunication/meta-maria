Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to bridge the gap in the scarce and
   inconclusive literature concerning the impact of gender diversity on
   earnings quality by positioning this relationship within an
   institutional context. It aims to investigate the moderating effect of
   different cultural dimensions and accounting values on the relationship
   between board gender diversity and earnings quality.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study uses an international sample
   from 46 countries (3,092 public firms) for the year 2017. A two-level
   hierarchical linear regression model is used to test the moderating
   effect of Hofstede's cultural dimensions and Gray's accounting values on
   diversity and accruals quality relationship.
   Findings - The findings suggest a positive relationship between board
   gender diversity and earnings quality. Results hold valid after
   controlling for endogeneity effect. More importantly, regarding national
   culture, results indicate that power distance, individualism,
   uncertainty avoidance, professionalism, uniformity, secrecy and
   conservatism moderate the relationship between female directors and
   accruals quality. Furthermore, different levels of female representation
   are essential on boards of different societies to use the benefits of
   gender-diversified boards in enhancing earnings quality.
   Research limitations/implications - The study provides empirical
   evidence on the effectiveness of various worldwide movements toward
   increasing board gender diversity. Additionally, the results speak
   directly to gender quota regulatory bodies suggesting that ``no size
   fits all{''} for gender quota requirement.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to the stream of literature
   concerning gender diversity and earnings quality by investigating this
   relationship through the lens of national culture and emphasizing the
   importance of considering institutional factors in examining social
   interactions.},

Title = {MALAYSIAN CHINESE CEOS AND FIRM PERFORMANCE},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Pages = {895-912},
Abstract = {This paper investigates whether Malaysian Chinese CEOs produce higher
   firm performance, in particular, the effect of ethnicity on financial
   performance from cultural dimensions. While the cultural dimension
   receives widespread attention in economics and sociology research, it
   has received much less attention in finance studies. The data covered
   were hand collected information on CEOs and board characteristics of
   firms listed in Bursa Malaysia over the 2009-2015 period. Using panel
   regression, the study documented empirical evidence that Malaysian
   Chinese CEOs deliver higher firm performance, especially if they
   graduated from overseas. Results are consistent even after controlling
   for firm level corporate governance characteristics. The findings
   suggest that Malaysian Chinese CEOs possess some quality traits that
   enable them to deliver higher firm performance. This is not only due to
   their cultural beliefs, but education profile as well. These findings
   contribute practical implications for CEO selection in corporations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS \& MONEY},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigate whether the cultural values of a parent
   bank's board members affect lending by the bank's foreign subsidiaries
   and how this influence is moderated by the board members' personal
   traits. Using a new dataset on foreign-owned banks and their parent
   companies, we find that average individualism, uncertainty avoidance,
   and indulgence within parent bank boards significantly impact lending by
   foreign subsidiaries. We establish that different sensitivities of
   female and male directors modify the relevance of individual cultural
   dimensions in lending by foreign bank subsidiaries. Moreover, we show
   that parent bank directors' cultural values have a stronger impact on
   lending by the bank's foreign subsidiaries when those directors have
   enough time to fulfill their duties and possess higher ownership stakes
   in the parent companies.},

   International Evidence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Number = {04},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study tests the effect of unbalanced power distance (PD) (i.e.,
   Hofstede's cultural dimensions PD index) and individual stock price
   crash risk. We examine the stock price behavior of listed firms in 37
   countries from 2004 to 2016 and use multivariate analyses to document
   that societal PD is important in explaining firms' propensity to release
   accounting information. This propensity suggests a psychological
   tendency regarding timing management, particularly for bad news. As
   countries with large PD prefer to keep things under control, the result
   is fewer unexpected stock price crashes during the long windows between
   election events. However, because large-PD countries focus their markets
   on maintaining temporary peace before and during periods of political
   events (i.e., national elections), crash risk increases after the
   political event window. Consistent with these predictions, we find that
   in large-PD countries, companies generally have less incentive to hide
   negative information and thus generate stock price crashes. This
   situation is substantially changed during the postpolitical windows,
   when firms and ways of spreading information are more controlled by the
   government. Our findings suggest that formal mechanisms alone are
   insufficient to explain the behaviors of corporate disclosure that are
   entangled with informal instruments.},

Title = {Does Board Cultural Diversity Contributed by Foreign Directors Improve
   Firm Performance? Evidence from Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Australian firms hire an increasing number of foreign directors who
   bring various cultural perspectives to their boards' conversations. We
   evaluate the effect of board cultural diversity contributed by foreign
   directors on firm performance for a sample of Australian companies,
   constituents of ASX200. We employ Hofstede's six cultural dimensions to
   estimate board cultural diversity. We document a positive relationship
   between board cultural diversity and firm performance as measured by
   Tobin's q and ROA after controlling for various board and firm
   characteristics. This suggests that more culturally diverse boards may
   bring benefits to their firms that outweigh the potential costs of
   conflict and miscommunication caused by cultural differences. Our
   finding holds after controlling for firm and time fixed effects,
   implementing an instrumental variable approach, controlling for a firm's
   foreign operations and presence, and using alternative cultural
   diversity measures. We find that not all aspects of cultural differences
   matter, and it is the diversity in masculinity, uncertainty avoidance,
   and long-term orientation dimensions that positively determine firm
   performance. This finding on the positive effect of board cultural
   diversity for Australian firms contrasts with the evidence from other
   countries, highlighting that the value of cultural diversity can differ
   across countries and over time.},
