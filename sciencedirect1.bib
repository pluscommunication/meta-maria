abstract = {Background
While risk of depression appears greatest in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, few studies have examined prenatal depression and its comorbidity with anxiety in Africa. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of prenatal depression and anxiety among pregnant women in Kenya, and to identify sociodemographic and health-related risk factors.
Method
A convenience sample of 395 pregnant women in their second or third trimesters was recruited. Depressive symptoms were screened for using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, with scores ≥12 indicating a high possibility of depression, and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale screened for anxiety with scores ≥10 indicating possible anxiety.
Results
Overall, 16.2% and 6.6% of women had depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and 12.5% of those with depressive symptoms also had anxiety. Multivariate ordinal logistic regressions revealed that unplanned pregnancy, income status, and feeling less happy about the pregnancy were significant predictors of both depression and anxiety. Younger maternal age and having no history of seeking psychological help also significantly increased the odds of depression and anxiety, respectively.
Limitation
The study sample represents women in the upper end of the economic spectrum, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to the general population of women in Kenya.
Conclusion
Depression and anxiety were less prevalent than in previous studies from low-and-middle income countries (LMICs), but still signify a threat to maternal mental health and pose a risk to maternal mental health and infant developmental outcomes. Routine screening for depression is recommended to enable timely intervention.}

Setting
a public hospital in Ankara Province Centre, Ankara, Turkey.
Participants
1,039 pregnant women selected using a convenience sampling method.
Findings
27.9% (n=290) of the 1,039 women were found to be experiencing depression at a level requiring treatment. In a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis model developed for depression and anxiety, the following were found to be statistically significant factors influencing the experience of both depression and anxiety: perceived social support; recent experience of marital or emotional problems during and before this pregnancy; recent experience of life stress; having a negative self-perception; experience of physical violence; and experience of physical problems during pregnancy. Statistically significant factors influencing depression were marital dissatisfaction, being a housewife, having an unwanted pregnancy, and having a formal marriage. The correlation between total anxiety and depression scores was at a medium level (Pearson correlation=0.592).
Key conclusions
many factors influenced the development of depression and anxiety in pregnancy, and a positive correlation was found between depression and anxiety. Midwives and nurses can evaluate pregnant women for these risk factors, and arrange for additional follow-up. They can also offer preventive care and, when necessary, assist with early diagnosis and treatment to improve the health of mothers and babies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Postpartum depression affects 10 up to 15 % of women of childbearing age in industrialized countries and presents significant public health problem which leads to short and long-term consequences for mother, child and her family. However, social determinants, including poverty, gender stereotypes, domestic violence, gender discrimination and cultural differences make this medical issue more problematic in less developed countries. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of postpartum depression at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Pristina, Kosovo (a tertiary referral center).
Material and methods
A prospective observational cohort study was conducted from June 2019 to October 2019 at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Pristina, Kosovo. A total of 247 delivery women were screened for postpartum depression at 6 weeks following delivery using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Socio-demographic, obstetric and psychologic factors were tested as predictors of PPD using bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis (Logit model). Odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for each risk factor. The p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
The prevalence of PPD at the Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynecology in Kosovo teaching hospital was 21 % at 6 weeks following childbirth. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four predictor variables for postpartum depression: pregnancy complications (OR 1.057; 95 % CI; 1.002–1.114 and P = 0.040); fear of childbirth (OR 1.121; 95 % CI; 1.057–1.190 and P = 0.00016); prenatal depression or anxiety (OR 1.088; 95 % CI; 1.032–1.147 and P = 0.0018); poor marital relation (OR 1.085, 95 % CI; 1.002–1.174 and P = 0.044). No statistically significant association was found between the postpartum depression (PPD) and maternal age, education, employment, family type, smoking, previous abortion, parity, household income, social support, child gender, birthweight, and breast feeding.
Conclusions
The high prevalence of postpartum depression in our setting and its known adverse effects on woman, infant and her family implies an urgent need for evidence-based interventions. Such interventions are needed to promote knowledge of perinatal mental illness and improve maternal mental health in particular in less developed countries. Future efforts should address early identification of high-risk women, assessment of risk factor during the antenatal period, early postpartum depression screening and timely therapeutic approaches, to improve social and psychological functioning of the woman.}

Meta-regression was used to determine annual change and presence of temporal trends. Survey logistic regression was used to examine the association with sociodemographic factors. Rates of diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorders demonstrated a temporal increase from 2004–2013, and this increase was mainly driven by non-maternal hospitalizations compared to maternal. Furthermore, non-maternal hospitalizations demonstrated a greater prevalence of depression and/or anxiety diagnoses compared to maternal hospitalizations over the same time period (21•7% versus 2•8%). Among all female hospitalizations, whites were roughly twice as likely as minorities to have a diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety. These results add to the evidence suggestive of the underdiagnosed depression/anxiety present among women of reproductive age, particularly pregnant women and minorities, and underscore the critical role of obstetricians in treating both physical and mental health.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Parents have faced substantial social and economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level.
Methods
In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time.
Findings
Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35·21%, 95% CI 32·48–38·04) and anxiety symptoms (31·39%, 28·76–34·15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8·31, 95% CI 7·97–8·65) and anxiety score (11·90, 11·66–12·13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·05, 4·85–5·25; mean anxiety score 9·51, 9·35–9·66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·43, 5·20–5·66; mean anxiety score 9·49, 9·33–9·65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5·79, 5·55–6·02; mean anxiety score 10·26, 10·10–10·42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2·30 points (95% CI 1·95–2·65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1·04 points (0·65–1·43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers.
Interpretation
Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

abstract = {Purpose
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a non-psychotic depressive disorder that begins within 4 weeks of childbirth. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PPD by screening mothers with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), to assess the behavioural outcome of children born to mothers with and without epilepsy and to investigate the relationship between PPD and children’s behavioural problems.
Method
We enrolled 80 pregnancies of women with epilepsy, who filled in EPDS after birth, and afterward we asked them to complete the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
Results
23.8% of patients presented PPD. Children, when the CBCL were completed, had a mean age of 6.05 ± 3.07 years. The CBCL results indicate the occurrence of at least one behavioural issue in 25.0% (20/80) of children. CBCL scores revealed a higher prevalence of behavioural disturbances with regards to the CBCL Total (P = 0.016), internalizing (P = 0.014) and somatic problems (P = 0.048) in patients with PPD vs. patients without PPD. We found an association between mothers’ EPDS total score and children’s CBCL global score (P = 0.034), internalizing score (P = 0.021), anxiety problems (P = 0.05), affective problems (P = 0.027) and withdrawn/depressed (P = 0.05). We recorded a statistically higher malformation rate in patients with PPD (P = 0.005) compared to the general population.
Conclusions
Children born from mothers with epilepsy have an increased risk for emotional disorders. These findings highlight the importance of screening for emotional distress and providing adequate interventions to children born to women with epilepsy.}

abstract = {Background
Infertility has been associated with psychological distress, but whether these symptoms persist after achieving pregnancy via assisted reproductive technology (ART) remains unclear. We compared the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms between women seeking for infertility treatment and women who conceived after ART or naturally.
Methods
Four hundred and sixty-eight sub-fertile non-pregnant women, 2972 naturally pregnant women and 143 women pregnant after ART completed a questionnaire in this cross-sectional study. The Anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A≥8) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS≥12) were used for assessing anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to explore associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Results
The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among sub-fertile, non-pregnant women (57.6% and 15.7%, respectively) were significantly higher compared to women pregnant after ART (21.1% and 8.5%, respectively) and naturally pregnant women (18.8% and 10.3%, respectively). History of psychiatric diagnosis was identified as an independent risk factor for both anxiety and depressive symptoms. The presence of at least one unhealthy lifestyle behavior (daily tobacco smoking, weekly alcohol consumption, BMI≥25, and regular physical exercise<2h/week) was also associated with anxiety (Prevalence Ratio, PR: 1.24; 95%CI: 1.09–1.40) and depressive symptoms (PR: 1.25; 95%CI: 1.04–1.49).
Conclusions
Women pregnant after ART showed no difference in anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to naturally pregnant women. However, early psychological counseling and management of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors for sub-fertile women may be advisable, particularly for women with a previous history of psychiatric diagnosis.}

Postpartum depression is underreported in developing countries because it considered stigmatized and treated differently from other diseases. Prenatal screening is essential to prevent comorbidities and provide appropriate management. The ten-item EPDS validated in various translation versions. However, some research shows the stability of different factors in several cluster dimensions. The research aims to confirm the model factor EPDS Indonesian version and test the consistency of the model factors are in pregnant women.
Methods
The EPDS structural factor for 616 in the third-trimester prenatal pregnant women in Makassar City. We present exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to measure the optimal factor and test the factor model obtained by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
Results
More than 60% of subjects have low education, the prevalence of mothers with EPDS>12 is 33.7% of the total 616, with the tendency of undergraduate, multiparous education, family income≤Wage Standard, household mothers, and extended families at higher risk of depression. The EFA results showed that three optimal factor models fit the data, namely anxiety, depression, and anhedonia. The CFA confirms that the three-factor model is valid.
Conclusion and recommendations
This study recommends a three-factor structure suitable identifies postpartum depression in Indonesia's female population. Therefore, this instrument relevant to use as a screening tools for postpartum depression. Nevertheless, for shorter screening needs, digital measuring devices’ transformation is needed to save time collecting and analysing results, especially in the settings of mother and baby services.}

To assess the frequency of perinatal Intimate Partner Violence (IPV), the association between IPV and depressive and anxiety symptoms, and the role of social support (SS) in the relation between IPV and depressive and anxiety symptoms, controlling for sociodemographic factors.
Method
Women were assessed during pregnancy and at six months postpartum (n = 210). The instruments used were: Stressful Life Events Scale; the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; the Anxiety Subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 and the Social Support Subscale of the Postpartum Depression Predictors Inventory-Revised.
Results
The prevalence of IPV was 10.7% in pregnancy and 11% during postpartum. IPV increases the risk of suffering depression in pregnancy (OR = 3.5) and at six months postpartum (OR = 18.3), as well as anxiety (OR = 5.9 and OR = 6.2, respectively). Women with lower educational attainment (OR = 3.8) and income (OR = 3.0) had a higher risk of being victims of IPV during pregnancy. Likewise, lack of SS has a great impact on IPV both during pregnancy (OR = 14.12) and the postpartum period (OR = 5.49). This association decreases the impact and significance of the relationship between perinatal depression and anxiety and IPV.
Conclusions
High levels of SS may partially offset the effect of IPV on postpartum depressive s and perinatal anxiety symptoms. it is necessary for IPV victims to have multiple protective factors. Lack of access to education, poverty and women’s submissive role in relation to men lead to greater vulnerability, constituting a distinct social disadvantage for women.}

Result(s)
Women with PCOS had worse BID scores on all five MBSRQ-AS subscales adjusted for age, body mass index, race, pregnancy history, income, and employment, and larger differences on the FRS compared with the control women. In multivariable regression models, the prevalence of depressive (28% vs. 19.2%) and anxiety (76.5% vs. 56.5%) symptoms were also statistically significantly higher in women with PCOS compared with the controls. Most MBSRQ-AS subscale scores statistically significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and quality of life scores. The association between PCOS/control status and higher anxiety and depression scores was completely mediated by the appearance evaluation and body areas satisfaction subscales and partially mediated by overweight preoccupation, appearance orientation, and self-classified weight.
Conclusion(s)
Women with PCOS have increased BID and depressive and anxiety symptoms. In our study different aspects of BID either fully or partially mediated the association between PCOS/control status and depression and anxiety scores, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeted at improving body image may decrease depressive and anxiety symptoms.

La mayoría de las puntuaciones de la subescala MBSRQ-AS se correlacionaron de forma estadísticamente significativa con las puntuaciones de depresión, ansiedad y calidad de vida. La asociación entre el status PCOS/control y las mayores puntuaciones en ansiedad y depresión estuvo completamente mediada con la evaluación de la apariencia y las subescalas de satisfacción de las áreas corporales y parcialmente mediada con la preocupación por el sobrepeso, la orientación de la apariencia y el peso auto-clasificado.

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate emotional distress and prenatal attachment throughout a subsequent pregnancy after Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) for fetal abnormality.
Methods
Observational study, in a French Tertiary Maternity. Population: 25 women in a subsequent pregnancy after a medical termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality, 18-year-old and older. Prenatal Interviews at 20 Gestationnal weeks (GW), 27 GW and 35 GW and Postnatal at 3 months and at each time self-administered questionnaires of anxiety, post-traumatic stress syndrome (PCLS) depressive symptoms (EPDS), prenatal attachment (PAI) and Perinatal Grief Scale (PGS).
Results
Pregnancy onset, i.e. before 20 GW, showed increased prevalence of anxiety (16/23, 66.7%), depression (7/23, 30.4%) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (4/16, 25%). Total score on PGS is higher in onset of pregnancy than in the third trimester (p = 0.005). Prenatal attachment was lower during early pregnancy (p = 0.003) and correlated inversely with grief intensity (p = 0.022). During late pregnancy, emotional symptoms decrease, and prenatal attachment stopped increase positively, specifically among women whose foetal abnormality in previous pregnancies were diagnosed late, at an average of 25 GW.
Conclusion
This research shows the specific dynamics of pregnancies following TOP and highlights the necessity for early prenatal psychological support. One should also pay special attention to prenatal attachment during late pregnancy even after knowing that the fetus is healthy.}

abstract = {Background
Depression is the most commonly diagnosed medical condition among women veterans ages 18 to 44; however, depression symptoms occurring during pregnancy have not been well-studied in this population.
Methods
Pregnant veterans were recruited from 15 Veterans Health Administration sites across the United States; our sample included 501 participants. Sociodemographic characteristics, military service, health status, and pregnancy related factors, as well as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), were collected as part of a telephone survey. Additional data were obtained from electronic health record data. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine factors associated with an EPDS score suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms (≥10).
Findings
Prenatal EPDS scores of 10 or greater were calculated for 28% of our sample. Our final model indicated that factors associated with decreased odds of an EPDS score of 10 or greater included spousal or partner support during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16–0.77) and employment (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24–0.67). A past diagnosis of anxiety (aOR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.43–4.50), past antidepressant use (aOR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.71–6.24), and active duty service (aOR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.08–3.37) were associated with increased odds of having an EPDS score of 10 or greater.
Conclusions
This is the first quantitative estimate of depression symptoms in pregnant veterans across multiple Veterans Affairs facilities. The prevalence of depression symptomology was greater than the high end of prevalence estimates in the general pregnant population. Given that the risk of depression increases during the postpartum period, women who can be identified with depressive symptomatology during pregnancy can be offered critical resources and support before giving birth.}

abstract = {Background
Globally, depression is prevalent during pregnancy and several factors have been associated with antenatal depressive symptoms (ADS). However, ADS have rarely been investigated in Thailand. This study aimed at exploring the prevalence of ADS and factors associated with these symptoms among Thai women in late pregnancy.
Methods
A cross-sectional study including 449 women in late pregnancy was carried out. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to detect depressive symptoms with a score of 10 points or higher. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial risks were measured in association with ADS. Percentage and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the prevalence of ADS. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were used to determine ADS-related risk factors among women.
Results
The prevalence of ADS was 46.8% (95%CI 42.3–51.4). Pregnant women aged less than 20 years (OR 2.58, 95%CI 1.14–5.84) and those not having enough money (OR 2.71, 95%CI 1.22–6.05) had an increased risk of ADS. Psychosocial risks related to ADS for women were low psychological well-being (OR 3.12, 95%CI 1.75–5.58), low self-esteem (OR 2.08, 95%CI 1.24–3.49), and low sense of coherence (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.12–2.95).
Conclusions
The prevalence of ADS among Thai women in their late pregnancy is high. Socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial factors are independently associated with ADS. Healthcare providers in Thailand should consider EPDS as a standardised screening tool for ADS and use it at antenatal care clinics. Implementing programs focusing on both pregnant women and their family might increase the prevention of perinatal depression.}

abstract = {Background
COVID-19 lockdown was associated with disruption of daily life, economy, essential health services including maternal health service, and psychological reflexes such as panic, sleep disorders, fear, anxiety, and depression.
Aim
To assess the perception of pregnant women on the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and the prevalence of common mental health disorders (CMHD) among pregnant women.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 380 pregnant women at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan; participants were enrolled using a simple random sampling technique. Data was collected using pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Information obtained – sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, perception and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, effect on ANC, coping mechanisms, and presence of CMHD (anxiety and depression) were measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data were analysed using STATA 16.0 Software. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed. The level of significance was p-value < 0.05.
Results
The mean age was 32 ± 4.78 years, most respondents were <35 years (75%), married (97.1%), had a higher education (89%) and multiparous (70%). About 43.9% were worried that COVID-19 would affect pregnancy care, 42.9% reported it affected care and 81.6% were not worried it would affect the delivery care. Among respondents, 96.6% were able to cope with the effects of the pandemic and 96.8% enjoyed good social support. Respondents did not have CMHD (88.16%), 7.9% had CMHD (4.74% had depression and 3.16% had anxiety) and 3.95% had co-morbid depression and anxiety. On multinomial regression analysis, relative to anxiety or depression only, respondents with combined depression and anxiety had higher odds of having no delivery plan and thought COVID-19 may affect their delivery.
Conclusion
Only a few women reported anxiety and depression symptoms during the lockdown and those with anxiety or combined symptoms of anxiety and depression had no birth plan and believed that COVID-19 would affect their delivery.}

abstract = {Objective
: To translate the PSI (Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory) into Turkish, to perform its cultural adaptation, to establish its reliability and validity, and to examine the prevalence of perceived pregnancy symptoms frequency and symptom-related limitation in Turkish pregnant women.
Design
: This cross-sectional study included healthy pregnant women over 18 years old from all 3 pregnancy trimesters. In the reliability analysis, the test-retest reliability was investigated by the Pearson correlation analysis. For the criterion validity of the PSI, correlations between the total pregnancy symptom frequency scores and the total scores of the Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Nottingham Health Profile were analyzed. Frequency and limitation perception prevalence of the symptoms were calculated as a percentage based on the response to each symptom. Statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.
Measurements and Findings
: In the present study, 210 pregnant women participated, and 42 pregnant women filled out the Turkish-PSI twice for the test-retest analysis. In the frequency and limitation sections of the PSI, the test-retest correlations for each symptom were found to vary between medium and very strong (0.42–1.00 and 0.39–1.00, p <0.05, respectively). Moderate correlations (rho = 0.39–0.58, p <0.05, p ≤ 0.001) were detected between the frequency section total score and the total scores of the other scales. The top four symptoms indicated as “often” by the Turkish pregnant women were urinary frequency (42.4%), fatigue/tiredness (28.6%), increased vaginal discharge (26.7%), and upper/lower back pain (23.8%).
Key conclusions
: The Turkish-PSI is a comprehensive, reliable, and valid inventory for evaluating a wide range of pregnancy symptoms in Turkish pregnant women. Further studies are needed to examine the sensitivity of the Turkish-PSI to treatment-induced changes.
Implications for practice
: Comprehensive and practical symptom questioning tools such as the PSI during pregnancy can lead to the early detection of pregnancy symptoms and to initiate effective non-pharmacological interventions.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant threat to perinatal mental health. This study examined differences in clinically significant depression, anxiety, and co-morbid symptoms among pregnant and postpartum women across several countries and compared prevalence of perinatal depression and anxiety before and during the pandemic in each participating country.
Methods
Participants were 3326 pregnant and 3939 postpartum women (up to six months postpartum) living in Brazil, Chile, Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. An online survey was completed between June 7th and October 31st 2020, and included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7). The pre-pandemic studies were identified through literature review.
Results
Prevalence of clinically significant depression (EPDS≥13), anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10), and co-morbid (EPDS≥13 and GAD-7 ≥ 10) symptoms was 26.7 %, 20 % and 15.2 %, in pregnant women, and 32.7 %, 26.6 % and 20.3 %, in postpartum women, respectively. Significant between-country differences were found in all mental health indicators in both perinatal periods. Higher levels of symptoms were observed during (versus before) the pandemic, especially among postpartum women.
Limitations
Participants were mostly highly educated and cohabiting with a partner. The online nature of the survey may have limited the participation of women from vulnerable socio-economically backgrounds.
Conclusions
Our findings expand previous literature on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health, by highlighting that this may be influenced by country of residence. Mental health care policies and interventions should consider the unique needs of perinatal women in different parts of the world.}

To describe the prevalence of sustained postpartum anxiety and to develop a multifactorial predictive model to assist in targeted screening procedures.
Methods
In a population-based cohort in a health region near Vancouver, Canada, 522 mothers completed a mailed questionnaire at 1, 4, and 8 weeks postpartum measuring socio-demographic, biological, pregnancy-related, life stressor, social support, obstetric, and maternal adjustment factors. We undertook a sequential logistic regression analysis to develop a multifactorial predictive model of sustained postpartum anxiety, as measured by a State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score >40 at 1 week and/or 4 weeks, and 8 weeks postpartum.
Results
The prevalence of sustained postpartum anxiety was 12.6% (95% CI 9.6–16.2). In the multivariable model, predictors of sustained anxiety in the postpartum period were perceived stress at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 3.74, 95% CI 2.17-6.44) and partner social support at 1 week (1 SD increase; aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40–0.85). Depression symptomatology at 1 week, child care stress, and maternal self-esteem were non-significant.
Limitations
Single women and women from ethnic minority backgrounds were underrepresented in the sample.
Conclusions
A large proportion of women experience sustained postpartum anxiety. High perceived stress and low partner social support can be used to facilitate early identification of women likely to experience persistent anxiety in the postpartum period and suggest the need for urgent access to psychotherapeutic services for these women. These factors may also be potential targets for individual or couples therapy to treat postpartum anxiety.}

Pregnant women often encounter psychiatric symptoms and declined sleep quality as pregnancy proceeds. The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19.
Methods
An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms.
Results
In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality.
Limitations
Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women.

Psychological morbidities are one of the emerging global health problems. It affects a considerable number of ante-natal women leading to consequences during the postnatal period as well. We conducted this research to study the magnitude and determinants of psychological morbidities during pregnancy.

In this study, we included 650 pregnant women from an established cohort of 2500 pregnant women and assessed the psychological morbidities among them using the GMHAT/PC tool.
Results
The overall prevalence of psychological morbidities during pregnancy was 14.6%, with anxiety and depression being the leading ones. Low education levels, lower socio-economic status, unintended pregnancy, complicated previous pregnancy, lack of family and social support, and domestic violence increased the odds of psychological morbidity. On Multivariate logistic regression, Low education levels increased the odds to more than twice [illiterate/primary schooling OR: 4.00, p = 0.026; secondary schooling OR: 2.64, p = 0.034; high school OR: 2.60, p = 0.033] unintended pregnancy [OR: 1.91, p = 0.043] and lack of family support [OR: 7.19, p < 0.001] increased the odds of psychological morbidity among pregnant women.
Conclusion
Bringing these issues to the mainstream and addressing them by developing interventions to address them during the lifecycle of a female will help to prevent episodes of psychological stress and morbidity among pregnant females.}

The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a dyadic PPD prevention program that targets both individual and couple/dyadic factors. The 5-week, online PPD prevention program included 18 couples (n=36, i.e., pregnant mothers and their partners). Data on individual and dyadic factors were collected at baseline and post-intervention. Feasibility data indicated that the program was both acceptable and well-received. Participants felt satisfied with the knowledge learned and skills gained in the program (91.6% of mothers, 90% of partners). Based on the results of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, participants demonstrated significant coping skills knowledge increases compared to pre-intervention scores (Z=-2.251, r=0.650, p=0.031 and Z=-2.264, r=0.716, p=0.031, for mothers and partners respectively).

abstract = {Background
Early exposures such as maternal smoking can be associated mental disorders. We aimed to analyze the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression in the 1993 birth cohort (Pelotas, Brazil).
Methods
Data on maternal smoking were collected in the perinatal study, while information on GAD and depression was collected at age 22 years using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Information on maternal mental health, the mediator, was collected at the 11-year follow-up. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess the association between exposure, outcomes, and analysis of negative controls.
Results
3,781 participants presented complete data. The incidence of GAD was 10.4%, depression 2.9%, and smoking during pregnancy 32.6%. The children of mothers who smoked had a 45% higher chance of developing GAD at age 22 years (OR 1.45; 95%CI 1.18; 1.80) and 75% higher chance of depression (OR 1.75; 95%CI 1.18; 2.59). Also, the higher the number of cigarettes smoked. the higher was the chance for the development of GAD. Paternal smoking was not associated with the outcomes. The mother's mental health accounted for 18.2% of the association between maternal smoking and GAD, and for 13.4% for maternal smoking and depression.
Limitations
Data for smoking during pregnancy were collected through a self-report. Residual confusion due to important variables cannot be ruled out.
Conclusions
MSDP was associated with the mental health of children in early adulthood. However, a small part of the effect found was mediated by the mother's mental health.}

Several lines of evidence indicate that significant prevalence of anxiety and depression-related disorders in MS patients can influence the progression of the disease. Although we and others have already reported the consequences of prenatal maternal immune activation on anxiety and depression, less is known about the interplay between maternal inflammation, MS and gender. We here investigated the effects of maternal immune activation with Poly I:C during mid-gestation on the progression of clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of MS), and then anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in non-EAE and EAE-induced offspring were evaluated. Stress-induced corticosterone and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in EAE-induced offspring were also measured. Maternal immune activation increased anxiety and depression in male offspring, but not in females. This immune challenge also resulted in an earlier onset of the EAE clinical signs in male offspring and enhanced the severity of the disease in both male and female offspring. Interestingly, the severity of the disease was associated with increased anxiety/depressive-like behaviors and elevated corticosterone or TNF-α levels in both sexes. Overall, these data suggest that maternal immune activation with Poly I:C during mid-pregnancy increases anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and the clinical symptoms of EAE in a sex-dependent manner in non-EAE or EAE-induced offspring. Finally, the progression of EAE in offspring seems to be linked to maternal immune activation-induced dysregulation in neuro-immune–endocrine system.}

The comorbid group also experienced a greater incidence of prematurity than the depressed, the high anxiety and the non-depressed groups. Although the comorbid and anxiety groups were lower birthweight than the non-depressed and depressed groups, the comorbid group did not differ from the depressed and anxiety groups on birth length. The neonates of the comorbid and depressed groups had higher cortisol and norepinephrine and lower dopamine and serotonin levels than the neonates of the anxiety and non-depressed groups as well as greater relative right frontal EEG. These data suggest that for some measures comorbidity of depression and anxiety is the worst condition (e.g., incidence of prematurity), while for others, comorbidity is no more impactful than depression alone.}

abstract = {Introduction
Pregnancy plays a unique role in the transformation of women towards completeness. For those women who have had a previous unsuccessful outcome, pregnancy may bring a lot of inevitable negative emotions. We studied psychiatric morbidity during second trimester of pregnancy subsequent to abortion in the previous pregnancy.
Methods
The study was carried out in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India. A total of 120 patients were divided into 4 groups depending on their pregnancy status. All the groups were compared with each other regarding their psychiatric morbidities, which were measured using various rating scales such as Hamilton Depression rating scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Presumptive Stressful Life events Scale, and Brief Psychotic Rating Scale.
Results
We found that subjects with history of previous abortion, whether single or more had significantly higher mean depression and anxiety score than primigravida or subjects with history of previous successful pregnancy; depression and anxiety scores decreased with increase in time gap between abortion and current pregnancy. High anxiety was found in 36.67%(11) of females with history of previous abortion. We also found that 36.67%(11) of subjects with previous single abortion and 30%(9) of subjects with previous 2 or more abortions were suffering from depressive episode. None of the female suffered from psychotic disorder.
Conclusions
The incidence of depression and anxiety is high in pregnancy after previous abortion and more in subjects who conceive earlier after previous abortion. These results warrant the need for screening all pregnancies for psychiatric morbidity after a previous abortion.}

No studies to date have observed maternal depression and suicide at immediate prenatal and early postpartum stages. In total, 213 Chinese women were recruited in hospitals after they were admitted for childbirth. All completed a short-term longitudinal survey at perinatal stages. Women reported lower depression scores (6.65) and higher suicidal ideation incidence (11.74%) after childbirth. Prenatal depression raised the possibility of prenatal suicidal ideation, while prenatal depression and suicidal ideation increased postpartum depression and suicidal ideation. At immediate prenatal stage, marital satisfaction protected women from depression, while miscarriage experiences and self-esteem increased the risk. At early postpartum stage, in contrast, being first-time mother, marital satisfaction, and harmony with mother-in-law prevented them from depression. Our study is among the first to confirm that women have decreased depression but increased suicidal ideation at early postpartum, and a causal relationship between them, which are worthy of public attention. Potential protective (marital satisfaction, being first-time mother, and harmony with mother-in-law) or risk factors (miscarriage experiences and self-esteem) of maternal depression and suicidal ideation are identified at perinatal stages. This offers reliable guidance for clinical practice of health care.}

abstract = {Background
Data concerning the impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection on the mental health of pregnant women are still limited. The study explored baseline information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the perinatal period, among mothers infected with COVID-19, during the first wave of the epidemic in Jordan. The current study aimed to examine the anxiety levels of pregnant women infected with coronavirus over the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from March to December 2021, using an online survey that addressed key issues related to the role of COVID-19 infection in developing anxiety among pregnant women using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The study population was pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, and who agreed to participate in the study (n=530).
Results
The results indicated that one-third of the women had contracted coronavirus infection in each trimester. Most had no pregnancy complications (78.0%), 42.0% had no symptoms of coronavirus infection, 10.0% were hospitalized and 2.0% were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Approximately half declared that they did not receive support from the medical staff, although 71.0% had very good support from their families. Nearly a quarter of respondents stopped smiling while infected, 19% did not want to have any entertainment, and one-third had sleep problems. Moreover, more than half of the pregnant women were feeling anxiety (58.0%) and fear (59.0%). The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 67%. The EPDS scores were statistically significant and associated with being a smoker, method of delivery, getting COVID-19, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and being admitted to a hospital or ICU.
Conclusions
This study highlights that healthcare providers and family members should pay more attention to maternal mental health during a pandemic. Fear and anxiety among pregnant women need to be taken into account more during the period of international crises, taking into account the mental health of the pregnant woman when developing health plans, developing health programs, and providing diagnostic and therapeutic management in the maternal care departments.}

Evaluation of the mental health of pregnant women during the early and peak stages of the Covid-19 outbreak
Design
Online survey
Participants
Pregnant women over the age of 18 years with no mental disorder during the pre-pregnancy period (N = 729).
Measurements and Findings
Mental disorders were assessed using the “Depression Anxiety Stress Scale” and social support was determined using the “Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.” Pregnant women had moderate levels of anxiety and depression and mild levels of stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress of moderate or high severity was reported in 62.2%, 44.6%, and 32.2% of the women, respectively. Pregnant women who lost their jobs during the pandemic period showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of anxiety, a 6-fold increase in the risk of depression, and a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of stress. An increase in the perception of social support has protective effects against all three mental disorders during pregnancy. In pregnant women with at least one obstetric risk, the risk of antenatal anxiety is 2 times higher than that in women with no risk. Similarly, women with a chronic physical illness before pregnancy have a higher risk of anxiety during pregnancy than healthy women. Financial strain has predictive value for anxiety and depression, and advanced age is a predictor for depression.
Key Conclusions
The incidence of mental disorders in pregnant women during the pandemic period was much higher than that during the pre-pandemic period. The high frequency of antenatal mental disorders can lead to an increase in the frequency of obstetric and maternal complications in the short and long term.
Implications for practice
Early detection of inadequate social support and economic difficulties of pregnant women during the pandemic period is recommended for protecting their mental health. Pregnant women should have easy access to psychosocial support, and they should be provided obstetric counseling during the pandemic conditions.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the prevalence of mental health problems during the perinatal period, little research has examined psychotic symptoms in a community sample across pregnancy and the postpartum. Exposure to environmental risk factors, and immigration in particular, are associated with increased risk for psychotic disorders. The current investigation examined whether psychosocial risk and immigrant status would predict levels of delusional ideation across the perinatal period when controlling for depression, anxiety, and demographic factors.
Methods
A community sample of 316 pregnant women was assessed at 12–14 and 32–34weeks gestation during routine clinic visits, and at 7–9weeks postpartum during a home visit. Measures included self-report ratings of psychosocial risk (e.g., history of mental health problems or abuse, stressful life events, lack of social support), pregnancy-related anxiety, depressive symptomatology, and delusional ideation.
Results
There was less delusional ideation during the postpartum period than during early pregnancy. Across all time points, levels of delusional ideation were lower than in the general population. Analyses using multilevel modeling indicated significant fixed-effects for the variables time, age, partnership, being religious and prenatal anxiety, but not depressive symptomatology, on delusional ideation. Immigrant status moderated the effect of psychosocial risk such that greater psychosocial risk predicted more symptoms of delusional ideation among immigrants, but not non-immigrants.
Conclusion
Psychosocial risk factors place immigrant women at an increased likelihood for experiencing delusional ideation during the perinatal period.}

To explore the influencing factors and relationships associated with prenatal depressive symptoms in pregnant women.
Methods
This study was a survey based cross-sectional investigation conducted on 750 pregnant women who underwent pregnancy and delivery examinations in a third class hospital in Urumqi City, and their general information was collected and a patient health questionnaire using a depression scale (Patients' Health Questionnaire Depression Scale - 9 item, PHQ - 9). Spss25.0 was used to compare the differences between the maternal depressive symptoms group and the non-depressed group, and Amos23.0 was used to construct a structural equation model to explore the influencing factors.
Results
The incidence of depressive symptoms in 750 pregnant women was 13.6 % (102/750) and maternal prenatal depressive symptoms was related to occupation, total monthly income, physical exercise, psychological preparation for pregnancy, residence status, couple relationship, knowledge about pregnancy and other factors (P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors for prenatal depressive symptoms in pregnant women included occupation (OR = 2.492), monthly gross income (OR = 1.293), psychological preparation for pregnancy (OR = 1.882), residential status (OR = 1.831), knowledge about pregnancy (OR = 2.028), prenatal anxiety (OR = 1.415), and pregnancy stress (OR = 4.590).

abstract = {Objective
This study of Canadian women estimates the prevalence of opioid and cannabis use during pregnancy and cannabis use during the breastfeeding period and explores the sociodemographic and mental health characteristics associated with use.
Methods
A total of 13 000 women who gave birth between January and June 2018 were invited to participate in the Survey on Maternal Health by Statistics Canada; 7111 women participated for a response rate of 54.7%. Participants were asked about their mental health, supports during pregnancy, and substance use. Multivariable logistic regression was used to describe the relationship between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics and substance use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.
Results
The prevalence of self-reported opioid use during pregnancy was 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1%–1.8%). A higher proportion of women reported using cannabis during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, at 3.1% (95% CI 2.5%–3.6%) and 2.6% (95% CI 2.1%–3.1%), respectively. Younger age, not being in a relationship, lower level of education, and thoughts of self-harm were significantly associated with cannabis use during pregnancy. Lower level of education and thoughts of self-harm were also significantly associated with cannabis use while breastfeeding, as were symptoms of postpartum depression and/or generalized anxiety. Lower level of education and symptoms of postpartum depression and/or generalized anxiety were also significantly associated with opioid use during pregnancy.
Conclusion
The results of this survey show relatively low levels of opioid and cannabis use during pregnancy and cannabis use while breastfeeding in Canada. Different sociodemographic and mental health characteristics are associated with the use of these substances, and public health interventions and policies should take into account these factors.
Résumé
Objectif
Cette étude menée auprès de Canadiennes estime la prévalence de la consommation d'opioïdes et de cannabis pendant la grossesse ainsi que la consommation de cannabis pendant l'allaitement; elle explore aussi les caractéristiques sociodémographiques et de santé mentale liées à la consommation.
Méthodologie
Au total, 13 000 femmes ayant accouché entre janvier et juin 2018 ont été invitées à participer à l'Enquête sur la santé maternelle de Statistique Canada; 7 111 femmes y ont participé, pour un taux de réponse de 54,7 %. Les participantes ont été questionnées au sujet de leur santé mentale, du soutien pendant la grossesse et de la consommation de substances psychoactives. Une analyse de régression logistique multivariée a été utilisée pour décrire le rapport entre les caractéristiques sociodémographiques et de santé mentale et la consommation de substances psychoactives pendant la grossesse et l'allaitement.
Résultats
La prévalence de la consommation autodéclarée d'opioïdes pendant la grossesse était de 1,4 % (intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 % : 1,1 %–1,8 %). Une proportion accrue de femmes ont déclaré avoir consommé du cannabis pendant la grossesse et l'allaitement, à savoir 3,1 % (IC à 95 % : 2,5 %–3,6 %) et 2,6 % (IC à 95 % : 2,1 %–3,1 %) respectivement. Le jeune âge, le fait de ne pas être en couple, le faible niveau de scolarité et les pensées d'automutilation étaient significativement associés à la consommation de cannabis pendant la grossesse. Le faible niveau de scolarité et les pensées d'automutilation étaient aussi significativement associés à la consommation de cannabis pendant l'allaitement, tout comme les symptômes de dépression post-partum et/ou d'anxiété généralisée. Le faible niveau de scolarité et les symptômes de dépression post-partum et/ou d'anxiété généralisée étaient aussi significativement associés à la consommation d'opioïdes pendant la grossesse.
Conclusion
Les résultats de cette enquête révèlent des taux relativement faibles de consommation d'opioïdes et de cannabis pendant la grossesse et de consommation de cannabis pendant l'allaitement au Canada. Différentes caractéristiques sociodémographiques et de santé mentale sont liées à la consommation de ces substances. Par conséquent, il y a lieu que les interventions et politiques de santé publique tiennent compte de ces facteurs.}

The prevalence of fear of childbirth in pregnant women is described to be about 20–25%, while 6–10% of expectant mothers report a severe fear that impairs their daily activities as well as their ability to cope with labour and childbirth. Research on fear of childbirth risk factors has produced heterogeneous results while being mostly done with expectant mothers from northern Europe, northern America, and Australia.
Aims
The present research investigates whether fear of childbirth can be predicted by socio-demographic variables, distressing experiences before pregnancy, medical-obstetric factors and psychological variables with a sample of 426 Italian primiparous pregnant women.
Methods
Subjects, recruited between the 34th and 36th week of pregnancy, completed a questionnaire packet that included the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, as well as demographic and anamnestic information. Fear of childbirth was treated as both a continuous and a dichotomous variable, in order to differentiate expectant mothers as with a severe fear of childbirth.
Findings
Results demonstrate that anxiety as well as couple adjustment predicted fear of childbirth when treated as a continuous variable, while clinical depression predicted severe fear of childbirth.
Conclusions
Findings support the key role of psychological variables in predicting fear of childbirth. Results suggest the importance of differentiating low levels of fear from intense levels of fear in order to promote adequate support interventions.}

The primary objective was to estimate the population prevalence of specific phobias (including pregnancy related specific phobias) and associated mental disorders. The secondary objective was to investigate the effectiveness of routinely collected screening tools (depression and anxiety screens, Whooley and GAD-2 respectively) in identifying specific phobias. Specific phobias are the most common anxiety disorder to occur during pregnancy, but studies on prevalence and clinical correlates of specific phobias, including pregnancy related specific phobias are lacking.
Design
Cross-sectional survey using a two-phase sampling design stratified according to being positive or negative on the Whooley questions routinely asked by midwives. Approaching all whooley positive women and drawing a random sample of Whooley negative women. Sampling weights were used to account for the bias induced by the stratified sampling.
Participants
545 pregnant women attending their first antenatal appointment. Language interpreters were used where required.
Setting
Inner-city maternity service, London, UK.
Measurements
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Mental Disorders were administered to assess mental disorders and 544 women responded to the anxiety module on specific phobias.
Results
The maternity population prevalence estimate for specific phobias was 8.4% (95%CI: 5.8–12.1%) and for pregnancy related phobias was 1.5% (95%CI: 0.6–3.7%), most of which were needle phobias. The prevalence estimate of tokophobia was 0.032% (95%CI: 0.0044–0.23%). Over half (52.4%) the women with specific phobias had comorbid mental disorders. Routinely administered screening tools (Whooley and GAD-2) were not helpful in identifying phobias.
Key conclusions and implications for practice
Phobias in pregnancy are common but pregnancy related phobias are rare, particularly tokophobia. As routinely administered screening tools were not helpful in identifying phobias, other indicators could be considered, such as avoidance of blood tests and requests for caesarean sections.}

abstract = {Objectives
Women with severe mental illnesses (SMI) may have elevated rates of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) due to an accumulation of risk factors. This study aims to determine the prevalence rate of HPD within a population of women with SMI and to report on rates within different mental illness diagnoses and types of medication exposure.
Study design
A retrospective multicentre study of 521 pregnant women attending specialised antenatal clinics for the management of established SMI.
Main outcome measures
Measures included sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy complications, mental health diagnosis and psychotropic medication use.
Results
Overall, 14% of women in the study had HDP. Compared to women with non-affective psychotic and other non-psychotic disorders (10.3%), women with depression and anxiety disorders demonstrated an increased risk of having a diagnosis of HDP (18.8%; RR = 1.82 [95% CI: 1.01, 3.29], p = .048). Log-binomial regression demonstrated that both a BMI in the overweight and obese range (RR = 3.37 [95% CI: 1.04, 10.95], p = .044) and continuous SNRI treatment throughout pregnancy (RR = 2.79 [95% CI; 1.33, 5.83], p = .006) were significant predictors of HDP, after adjusting for maternal age, gestational diabetes, and other mental health diagnoses.
Conclusion
Women with severe mental illnesses have elevated risk of developing HPD. Management remains complex and should address their comorbid risk profiles, and weigh up the risks and benefits of psychotropic medication use, given these results provide evidence of elevated rates of HDP associated with exposure to SNRI when taken throughout pregnancy.}

Antenatal depression was not associated with obstetric or neonatal outcomes. Antenatal depression symptoms strongly predict depression and anxiety symptoms at T2 and T3. The EPDS, KGB, STAI and BDI, but not the HAMD, scores, were significantly lower at T3 than before. The incidence of depression significantly decreased from T1 (23.8%) to T2 (7.8%) and T3 (5.3%). T1 Hct values significantly predicted the T3 postnatal EPDS, STAI, KGB and BDI scores. Delivery significantly improves depression and anxiety symptoms.

abstract = {Background
women who have inadequate nutrient intake are more likely to develop a risky pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of eating disorders and its association with anxiety and depression symptomatology in high-risk pregnancies.
Methods
this is a cross-sectional and prospective study conducted at the tertiary university hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. 913 pregnant women waiting for the Obstetrics' outpatient appointment were invited to participate in the study on their 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Structured interviews were carried out and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were applied.
Findings
prevalence of eating disorder (ED) during pregnancy was 7.6% (n=69) (95% CI: 5.84% −9.28%), 0.1% (n=1) for anorexia nervosa; 0.7% (n=6) for bulimia nervosa; 1.1% (n=10) for binge eating disorder, and 5.7% (n=52) for pica. A statistically significant difference was found between the anxiety (p<0.01) and depressive symptoms (p<0.01).
Conclusions
the prevalence of ED (7.6%) and its association with anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy highlights the need for specialist care for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Given the importance of proper nutrition during pregnancy, both with regard to maternal health and fetal development, it is necessary to have specific predetermined evaluation protocols implemented by health care professionals for the diagnosis of ED during pregnancy.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Pregnancy and postpartum are vulnerable periods for mental health problems and distress. Studies conducted worldwide have highlighted the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in adding to the rates of depression and anxiety in the perinatal period. However, there are very few reports on mothers who were identified as having COVID-19 infection at the time of childbirth.
OBJECTIVE
Our study aimed to find the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pregnant women who were admitted for labor and tested positive for COVID-19 infection. We also aimed to study the association of various sociodemographic, social support, and obstetrical factors and that of COVID-19-related worries with depression and anxiety.
STUDY DESIGN
The study was conducted at the obstetrics inpatient setting in a public hospital in New Delhi, which had a separate designated COVID-19 block. Pregnant and postpartum women >18 years of age who were admitted to the COVID-19 maternity ward for delivery were included for this study. The women were interviewed within the first week of admission and after 6 to 8 weeks of childbirth. The sociodemographic and obstetrical details and COVID-19-related worries and concerns were assessed. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire version 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale, respectively. The normally distributed variables are expressed as mean±standard deviation and continuous variables with skewed distribution as median (interquartile range). The categorical data presented as proportions of categorical variables were compared using the chi-square or the Fischer exact test. All the tests are 2-sided, with a significance level of 5%. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 24. The rates of depression and anxiety were calculated and univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with moderate and severe anxiety and depression using various sociodemographic and obstetrical variables, the total COVID anxiety scale scores, and the social support score.
RESULTS
The mean age of the women was 26.86 years (±4.31). Of the 243 women assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire version 9, 168 (69.13%) had mild depressive disorder, and 29 (11.3%) had moderate depressive disorder. Of the 187 women who were assessed at the 6-weeks follow-up, 31 (16.57%) had minimal depression, 131 (70.05%) had mild depression, and 25 (13.36%) had moderate depression. Mild anxiety was seen in 121 cases (49.79%) and 13 (5.34%) had moderate anxiety symptoms. Women reported several worries, especially about the stigma of COVID-19 infection, support for infant care, and access to infant health services.
CONCLUSION
Screening for common mental illnesses with the timely identification of associated risk factors should be done, with a liaison between obstetricians and mental health professionals. Obstetricians can address and reassure pregnant women regarding concerns about contracting the infection, worries about the possible effects of COVID-19 on the fetus and the newborn, and concerns about future consultations. In case the worries are out of proportion and necessitate intervention by mental health professionals, referral services should be made available. Hence, identifying and addressing the mental health concerns will help provide the optimum perinatal care during the pandemic.}

abstract = {Background
Prenatal mental disorders are associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, while few studies have been performed in mainland China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of maternal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy and provide scientific basis for reducing prenatal mental disorders.
Methods
Data were obtained from 1220 women with < 15 weeks gestation in a cohort study conducted in Chongqing, China. Prenatal stress, anxiety and depression were assessed using the pregnancy pressure scale, the Hamilton anxiety scale, and the self-rating depression scale, respectively.
Results
The prevalence of prenatal stress, anxiety and depression in early pregnancy was 91.86%, 15.04% and 5.19%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for prenatal stress include housewife/unemployment, presence of anxiety and low- and moderate-level social support, besides, the protective factors were exercise, active smoking and no suggestion from parents. Housewife/unemployment, primiparity, presence of stress and depression and low-level social support were found to be associated with the development of anxiety symptoms, whereas exercise had a protective effect on it. Group-oriented personality, presence of anxiety, no suggestion from husband, low- and moderate-level family care, and low-level social support were risk factors for prenatal depression.
Limitations
All participants were recruited from one region of China, and none of them have a history of cesarean section.
Conclusion
Early screening and intervention may have great significance for reducing mental disorders of pregnant women, and the family and society support should be brought into the intervention as well.}

abstract = {Background
Anxiety and depression are common among women during pregnancy and the year after birth. The consequences, both for the women themselves and for their children, can be considerable and last for many years. This study focuses on the economic consequences, aiming to estimate the total costs and health-related quality of life losses over the lifetime of mothers and their children.
Method
A pathway or decision modelling approach was employed, based on data from previous studies. Systematic and pragmatic literature reviews were conducted to identify evidence of impacts of perinatal anxiety and depression on mothers and their children.
Results
The present value of total lifetime costs of perinatal depression (anxiety) was £75,728 (£34,811) per woman with condition. If prevalence estimates were applied the respective cost of perinatal anxiety and depression combined was about £8500 per woman giving birth; for the United Kingdom, the aggregated costs were £6.6 billion. The majority of the costs related to adverse impacts on children and almost a fifth were borne by the public sector.
Limitations
The method was exploratory in nature, based on a diverse range of literature and encountered important data gaps.
Conclusions
Findings suggest the need to allocate more resources to support women with perinatal mental illness. More research is required to understand the type of interventions that can reduce long-term negative effects for both mothers and offspring.}

abstract = {Background
Although many perinatal women are affected by anxiety, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and its potential triggers. The primary aim of this study was to examine concurrent and prospective associations between mid-pregnancy insomnia and perinatal anxiety. Furthermore, we compared psychosocial and reproductive characteristics between participants with and without mid-pregnancy insomnia and explored changes in the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms from mid-pregnancy to 8 weeks postpartum.
Methods
This study was part of the Norwegian Depression and Anxiety in the Perinatal Period (DAPP) prospective, population-based, cohort study. We analyzed hospital birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy week 17 and postpartum week 8 (n = 530). The Bergen Insomnia Scale was used to measure insomnia and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist to measure anxiety. OCD symptoms were measured based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
Results
Mid-pregnancy insomnia was significantly associated with both concurrent and postpartum anxiety in a linear mixed model adjusted for several potential confounders. Participants with mid-pregnancy insomnia had significantly higher levels of perinatal anxiety and postpartum OCD symptoms than participants with normal mid-pregnancy sleep. OCD symptoms affected more women after delivery than before (6.4% vs. 3.8% p = 0.034).
Limitations
Immigrants were underrepresented in our sample.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that mid-pregnancy insomnia is a marker for concurrent anxiety and predictor of postpartum anxiety. Future research should examine whether insomnia treatment starting in mid-pregnancy reduces both perinatal insomnia and anxiety. Health providers should also be aware that postpartum women have an increased risk of developing OCD symptoms.}

The increase in prevalence of ASD and the heterogeneity of symptom severity may arise from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors that alter synaptic plasticity. Maternal stress during pregnancy, which is linked to depression, may be one risk factor for an ASD phenotype in offspring. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment can be effective in alleviating maternal depression but prenatal SSRI exposure itself may be a risk factor for autism in offspring. The present study investigated in C57BL/6J pregnant mice whether restraint stress (G4–18) and/or treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine (G8–18) affects autism-related behaviors and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in male and female offspring. The findings indicate that restraint stress reduces preference for sucrose reward in pregnant dams that is reversed by fluoxetine. In adult male offspring, combined prenatal stress and SSRI exposure increased self-grooming and impaired spatial reversal learning. In adult female offspring, the prenatal experiences did not affect self-grooming, but restraint stress alone or SSRI exposure alone impaired spatial reversal learning. Prenatal stress reduced anxiety-related behavior in male and female offspring. Further, LTP induced by theta-burst stimulation of Schaffer-commissural afferents in field CA1 was significantly reduced in female offspring exposed to prenatal stress alone or combination with fluoxetine. Together, these findings suggest that exposure to prenatal stress, SSRI treatment or the combination differentially affects male and female offspring in autism-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity.}

abstract = {Background
Perinatal depression is a common condition of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Depression negatively affects engagement in HIV care, but systematic screening for perinatal depression is not done in most sub-Saharan African countries. Estimating the burden and timing of perinatal depression can help inform medical programs with the current scale-up of HIV care for pregnant women.
Methods
Women (n = 299) initiating antiretroviral therapy for HIV were recruited from a government antenatal clinic in Malawi in 2015–2016 into a cohort study. Probable perinatal depression was assessed at enrollment and at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We estimated point prevalence and incidence of depression as well as concordance between EPDS and PHQ-9 scores.
Results
One in ten women screened positive for probable antenatal depression, whereas 1–6% screened positive postpartum. Sensitivity analyses to account for loss to follow-up suggested that postpartum depression prevalence could have ranged from 1–11%. At postpartum time points, 0–3% of participants screened positive for incident probable depression. EPDS and PHQ-9 scores were concordant for 96% of assessments during antenatal and postpartum visits.
Limitations
Lack of diagnostic psychiatric evaluation precludes actual diagnosis of major depression, and social desirability bias may have contributed to low postpartum scores.
Conclusions
Probable depression was more common during the antenatal period than postpartum among our participants. Given the association between depression and negative HIV outcomes, screening for depression during pregnancy should be integrated into antenatal HIV care.}

Pregnant women are emotionally vulnerable and have suffered great psychological impacts. Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China.
Methods
A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy.
Results
A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression.
Conclusions
Our study revealed factors associated with psychological symptoms among pregnant women in the post-COVID-19-pandemic era. These results should help to update guidance for psychological interventions for pregnant women during the period of COVID-19.}

This study aimed to describe the prevalence trends of pre- and postnatal depression, via measures of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) total and factor scores, from 20 weeks’ gestation to 3 months postpartum, stratified by parity, in a Japanese female population.
Methods
A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at maternity facilities in Setagaya area of Tokyo, Japan. Of the 1775 women who participated, 1311 women met the inclusion criteria of this analysis. All data, including EPDS, were collected via self-administrated questionnaires at 20 weeks’ gestation and at 5 time points postpartum, from the first few days to 3 months postpartum. We divided EPDS items into three factors: “anxiety,” “anhedonia,” and “depression,” according to factor analysis.
Results
The prevalence of individuals exhibiting depressive symptoms, EPDS total score, and each factor score peaked at two weeks postpartum in primiparas (EPDS total = 5.58, anhedonia = 0.47, anxiety = 2.64, and depression = 1.23). In contrast, the EPDS total score and factor scores for “anxiety” and “depression” gradually decreased for multiparas, from the prenatal to postpartum period (EPDS total 3.33, 3.03, 3.03, 2.72, 2.76, and 2.37).
Limitations
Each factor score was not weighted; instead, we simply added up the item scores ranging from 0 to 3 for each question. Additionally, the population representativeness of Japanese women was not high, although the sample was population-based and had a high follow-up rate.
Conclusions
This study shows that the trends of EPDS total and factor scores differ by parity throughout the pre- and postnatal periods among a Japanese female population.}

Anxiety and related disorders (AD) disproportionately affect women, and are the most prevalent of all mental health conditions. The current research represents the first study of maternal postpartum AD prevalence in which all of the AD are assessed, and one of few studies of this type in which maternal prenatal AD incidence is assessed.
Methods
A Canadian sample of pregnant women (N=310) was recruited from a defined geographical area between November 2007 and November 2010. Participants were first administered postnatal mood and anxiety screening measures. Those who scored at or above cutoff on one or more of these measures were administered a diagnostic interview for depression and anxiety at approximately three months postpartum (n=115). Findings from the diagnostic interview were used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of mood and AD in pregnancy, as well as at and during the first three months postpartum. Period prevalence and incidence estimates were obtained retrospectively from interview data collected postnatally.
Results
The prevalence of AD during pregnancy and the early postpartum period (15.8% and 17.1% respectively) exceeded that of depression (3.9% and 4.8% respectively). The prevalence of OCD in our sample exceeded that of OCD among adults aged 18–64. Parity was unrelated to AD prevalence. Slightly less than 5% of participants were comorbid for both AD, and depression.
Limitations
This study is limited by a relatively small sample size for a prevalence study, and non-random sample selection. As only women who scored above cutoff on one or more screening measures were interviewed, prevalence estimates are conservative. Finally, prenatal prevalence estimates are based on retrospective report provided postpartum.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that, as a group, anxiety and related conditions affect a significant proportion of postpartum women, and are more prevalent than is postpartum depression.}

Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) impact multiple domains of maternal and child well-being. Estimates of postpartum depressive symptoms range from 6.5% to 12.9% and from 8.6% to 9.9% for postpartum anxiety. We sought to identify the role social support could play in mitigating PMADs.
Methods
The data are drawn from the Listening to Mothers in California survey; results are representative of women who gave birth in 2016 in a California hospital. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 was used to assess total symptoms of PMADs and anxiety and depressive symptoms individually. Two questions adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were used to assess emotional, practical, and functional (combined) social support. After exclusions for missing data related to PMADs or social support, we analyzed data from 2,372 women.
Results
At the time of survey administration (mean 5.7 months after birth), 7.0% of respondents reported elevated PMAD symptoms and 45.9% reported that they always received functional social support. In multivariable analysis, controlling for demographic and pregnancy-related factors and prenatal anxiety and depressive symptoms, women who reported consistent support had a prevalence of elevated PMAD symptoms one-half that of those who did not (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.74).
Conclusions
This study suggests that consistent social support serves as a robust protective factor against postpartum symptoms of PMADs. Because many predictors of PMADs are not modifiable, social support stands out as an important target for programmatic intervention, particularly in light of increased isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.}

abstract = {Objective
Prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in gestational diabetes mellitus ranges from 10.2% to 39.9% based on previous studies in Malaysia. Presence of depression, anxiety or stress in pregnancy may increase the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of neonatal outcomes and its association among mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus with and without the presence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in Malaysia.
Design
This was a cross-sectional study.
Setting
Tertiary hospitals in Malaysia.
Participants
Mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 418) who deliver their neonates at two major tertiary hospitals in Malaysia.
Measurements
Neonatal outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, macrosomia, metabolic and electrolyte disorders, neonatal respiratory distress and congenital anomalies were determined.
Findings
Prevalence of low birth weight in neonates born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus was 14.6%, followed by metabolic and electrolyte disorders 10.5%, preterm birth 9.1%, macrosomia 4.8%, neonatal respiratory distress 5.8% and congenital anomalies (2.4%). Among the adverse neonatal outcomes, neonatal respiratory distress was significantly associated with the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus using univariate analysis (p = 0.010). After controlling for confounding factors, predictors for neonatal respiratory distress at delivery were the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (Adjusted OR = 3.87, 95% CI = 1.32-11.35), living without a husband (Adjusted OR = 9.74, 95% CI = 2.04–46.51), preterm delivery (Adjusted OR = 7.20, 95% CI = 2.23–23.30), caesarean section (Adjusted OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.09–10.15), being nulliparous and primiparous (Adjusted OR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.17–11.17) and having family history of diabetes (Adjusted OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.11–9.21).
Key conclusions
The findings of this study demonstrate the positive association of neonatal respiratory distress with the presence of depression symptoms in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus.
Implications for practice
It is therefore important to identify depression symptoms after a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant mothers is made to enable early referral and interventions.}

abstract = {Background
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an antenatal psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum depression in Mexican women.
Method
Pregnant women at high risk for depression were randomized to intervention or a usual care condition. Assessments of depression (SCID, BDI-II) occurred during pregnancy, 6weeks and 4–6months postnatally, and subjective impact of the intervention in the postpartum.
Results
Of the 6484 women approached, 377 were eligible and consented to randomization (250 intervention, 127 control). Sixty-eight intervention (27.2%) and 68 (53.5%) control participants completed the three assessment periods. The cumulative incidence of major depression over three time periods was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the intervention (10.7%) than the control group (25%). Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant reduction of BDI-II in both groups, but no significant treatment effect. Even when controlling for initial levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms, a treatment effect on depressive symptoms could not be confirmed, although there was a trend demonstrating that intervention participants with high initial symptoms had a larger reduction of BDI-II. Most participants that completed the intervention reported that it had a medium to great influence on their well-being, depression, current problems, role as mothers and their relationship with the baby.
Limitations
Attrition was the most salient methodological problem in this study.
Conclusions
This is the first randomized control depression prevention trial in high-risk pregnant Mexican women. Available data are consistent with the possibility that the incidence of depression may have been reduced by the intervention, but differential attrition makes interpretation of the findings difficult.}

abstract = {Background
Recent evidence suggests that prenatal maternal distress increases the risk of allergic diseases in offspring. However, the effect of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety on atopic dermatitis (AD) risk remains poorly understood.
Objective
We investigated whether prenatal maternal distress is associated with AD risk in offspring and whether the mechanism is mediated by reactive oxygen species.
Methods
Two general population-based birth cohorts formed the study. One cohort (Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and Allergic Diseases [COCOA]) consisted of 973 mother-baby dyads, and the other (Panel Study on Korean Children [PSKC]) consisted of 1531 mother-baby dyads. The association between prenatal distress and AD was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models. In COCOA placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 and glutathione levels and serum IgE levels in 1-year-old children were measured.
Results
In COCOA and PSKC AD occurred in 30.6% (lifetime prevalence) and 11.6% (1 year prevalence) of offspring, respectively. Prenatal maternal distress increased the risk of AD in offspring, both in COCOA (hazard ratio for depression, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.02-1.69]; hazard ratio for anxiety, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.06-1.89]) and PSKC (odds ratio for distress, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.06-3.25]). In COCOA both prenatal maternal depression and anxiety scores were positively related to the predicted probability of AD (P < .001 in both). Prenatal distress decreased placental glutathione to glutathione disulfide ratios (P = .037) and, especially in those who later had AD, decreased placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 levels (P = .010) and increased IgE levels at 1 year of age (P = .005).
Conclusion
Prenatal maternal depression and anxiety promote risk of AD in offspring. Maternal distress increases the predicted probability of AD. The mechanism might involve chronic stress, abnormal steroid levels, and reactive oxygen species.}

abstract = {Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the serotonin (5-HT) reuptake transporter (SERT) and increase synaptic 5-HT. 5-HT is also important in brain development; hence when SSRIs are taken during pregnancy there exists the potential for these drugs to affect CNS ontogeny. Prenatal SSRI exposure has been associated with an increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and peripheral 5-HT is elevated in some ASD patients. Perinatal SSRI exposure in rodents has been associated with increased depression and anxiety-like behavior, decreased sociability, and impaired learning in the offspring, behaviors often seen in ASD. The present study investigated whether perinatal exposure to citalopram causes persistent neurobehavioral effects. Gravid Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups and subcutaneously injected twice per day with citalopram (10mg/kg; Cit) or saline (Sal) 6h apart on embryonic day (E)6-21, and then drug was given directly to the pups after delivery from postnatal day (P)1-20. Starting on P60, one male/female from each litter was tested in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM) and open-field before and after MK-801. A second pair from each litter was tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) and open-field before and after (+)-amphetamine. A third pair was tested as follows: elevated zero-maze, open-field, marble burying, prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, social preference, and forced swim. Cit-exposed rats were impaired in the MWM during acquisition and probe, but not during reversal, shift, or cued trials. Cit-exposed rats also showed increased marble burying, decreased time in the center of the open-field, decreased latency to immobility in forced swim, and increased acoustic startle across prepulse intensities with no effects on CWM. The results are consistent with citalopram inducing several ASD-like effects. The findings add to concerns about use of SSRIs during pregnancy. Further research on different classes of antidepressants, dose-effect relationships, timing of exposure periods, and mechanisms for these effects are needed. It is also important to balance the effects described here against the effects of the disorders for which the drugs are given.}

Design: A longitudinal population-based study in which participants completed psychosocial measures of depression, anxiety and PTSD in pregnancy (n = 950), 4-6 weeks (n = 858) and 6 months (n = 829) after birth. Setting: A consecutive sample of pregnant women were recruited from three maternity hospitals in three cities of Turkey: Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Measures: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) were used to assess depression, anxiety and PTSD, respectively. Findings: Depression and PTSD peaked at 4-6 weeks postpartum and then fell at 6 months postpartum, whereas anxiety followed a gradually declining linear-pattern from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The prevalence of depression was 14.6% in pregnancy, 32.6% at 4-6 weeks and 18.5% at 6 months postpartum, respectively. The prevalence of PTSD was 5.8% in pregnancy, 11.9% at 4-6 weeks postpartum and 9.2% at 6 months postpartum. Anxiety was highest in pregnancy (29.6%) and then decreased to 24.6% 4-6 weeks after birth and to 16.2% 6 months after birth. New-onset cases were most apparent at 4-6 weeks postpartum: 24.6% for depression; 13.7% for anxiety and 8.9% for PTSD. Key conclusions: A relatively high prevalence of psychological disorders was identified during the perinatal period. Anxiety was most prevalent in pregnancy, and depression and PTSD were highest at 4-6 weeks postpartum. Depression was more common than anxiety 4-6 weeks and 6 months after birth and highly comorbid with anxiety throughout this period. New-onset cases were observed at both 4-6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Implications: High rates of affective disorders in pregnancy and after birth highlight three main points: first, it is important to have effective perinatal screening to identify women with psychological needs; second, providing early treatment to women experiencing severe psychological problems is essential to ensure psychological well-being of those women and to prevent chronicity; and finally, psychosocial screening and interventions should be offered until at least 6 months after birth to catch new-onset cases.}

abstract = {Objectives
Pregnancy is associated with elevated risk for poor sleep quality, which increases the risk for poor obstetrical outcomes and parent mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen increased reports of disturbed sleep worldwide; however, the degree this extends to pregnancy or influences pregnancy mental health outcomes has not been examined. The goal of this study was to examine changes in pregnant individuals’ sleep, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and to understand how sleep was associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression over time.
Methods
The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. About 3747 pregnant individuals participated between April and July 2020. The present analysis was restricted to participants who completed at least 2 assessments, yielding a final sample of 1842 pregnant individuals.
Results
Depression symptoms were elevated at baseline, compared to prepandemic estimates of prevalence, but declined gradually over time. Shorter sleep duration, higher sleep disturbance, and more sleep-related impairments at baseline predicted a slower decline in depression symptoms over time. More sleep disturbances at baseline also predicted slower decline in anxiety symptoms over time. In contrast, rates of depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline were not predictive of changes in any of the 3 sleep variables over time.
Conclusions
These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for sleep problems in pregnancy, in order to optimize mental health throughout pregnancy and mitigate long-term negative outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Poor mental health status among both pregnant and postpartum women is commonly reported worldwide. The associations between mental health outcomes and giving birth to the second child since the implementation of China's universal two-child policy have not been identified.
Methods
A large-scale based mental health survey was conducted between March 2017 and December 2018 in Suzhou, China. The survey evaluated the symptoms of anxiety, hypomania, depression and poor sleep quality among both pregnant and postpartum women.
Results
A total of 3113 questionnaires were collected, the prevalence of anxiety, hypomanic and depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality in our sample were 3.2% (95%CI: 2.6%–3.9%), 51.7% (95%CI: 49.9%–53.4%), 12.4% (95%CI: 11.3%–13.6%) and 37.8% (95%CI: 36.0%–39.5%), respectively. Logistic regression showed that giving birth to the second child was positively associated with women's age, and was negatively correlated with higher educational level and living in rented housing. Women with the second pregnancy or child were positively associated with anxiety symptoms in the whole sample (OR = 1.75, 95%CI: 1.11–2.75) and among prenatal women (OR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.16–3.83), while it was inversely correlated with depressive symptoms among postpartum women (OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.41–0.99).
Conclusions
Women giving birth a second time were more prone to have anxiety symptoms among the prenatal women and the whole sample, and less likely to have depressive symptoms among the postpartum women. Efficacious measures and interventions are essential to improve maternal mental health.}

abstract = {Background
On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China.
Study Design
A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups.
Results
Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.
Conclusion
Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.}

abstract = {Objectives
To assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health problems in a cohort of women in early pregnancy. To describe the relationship between poor mental health and sociodemographic characteristics, self-efficacy and support networks. To assess if participants were representative of the local antenatal population.
Research design and setting
The UK government has pledged money to provide more support for women with perinatal mental health issues. Understanding the prevalence and predicting women who may need support will inform clinical practice. This paper reports part of the larger ‘Mothers Mood Study’, which explored women's and midwives’ experience of mild to moderate perinatal mental health issues and service provision. Routinely collected population level data were analysed and a smaller cross-sectional survey design used to assess predictors of poor mental health in early pregnancy in one health board in Wales.
Participants
Routinely collected data were extracted for all women who registered for maternity care between May 2017 and May 2018 (n = 6312) from the electronic maternity information system (pregnant population). Over a three month period 302 of these women completed a questionnaire at the antenatal clinic after an ultrasound scan (participants). Eligible women were aged ≥18 years, with sufficient spoken and written English to complete the questionnaire and a viable pregnancy of ≤18 weeks’ gestation. The questionnaire collected data on sociodemographic status, self-efficacy and support networks, self-reported mental health problems. Current anxiety and depression were assessed using the General Anxiety Disorders Assessment and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
Findings
Among the pregnant population 23% (n = 1490) disclosed a mental health problem during routine questioning with anxiety and depression being the most common conditions. Participants completing the detailed questionnaire were similar in age and parity to the pregnant population with similar levels of depression (15.6%; n = 15.6 v 17.3%, n = 1092). Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and General Anxiety Disorder 7 scores identified 8% with symptoms of anxiety (n = 25) or depression (n = 26) and a further 24.2% (n = 73) with symptoms of mild anxiety and 25.2% (n = 76) with mild depression. Low self-efficacy (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12–1.45), a previous mental health problem (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.37–11.33) and low support from family (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00–1.27) were found to be associated with early pregnancy anxiety and/or depression.
Key conclusions and implications for practice
Around one in five women who register for maternity care may have a mental health problem. Mild to moderate anxiety and depression are common in early pregnancy. Services need to improve for women who do not currently meet the threshold for referral to perinatal mental health services. Assessment and active monitoring of mental health is recommended, in particular for pregnant women with risk factors including a history of previous mental health difficulties, poor family support or low self-efficacy.}

Little is known about the prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) during pregnancy and its risk factors. The aims of this study are to determine the prevalence of CAD in the third trimester of pregnancy and analyse its association with socio-demographic, obstetric, and mental health features.
Methods
In a sample of 934 Italian pregnant women, CAD was defined as having (1) a score of ≥ 10 on the EPDS - depression subscale and/or on the PHQ-9, and (2) a score of ≥ 40 on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory State and/or a score of ≥ 6 on the EPDS - anxiety subscale. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify socio-demographic, obstetrics, and mental health risk factors of CAD.
Results
The prevalence of CAD was 6.8%. Age between 30 and 35 years (OR=3.01, 95% CI: 1.22–7.45) compared to younger age, current sleep disorders (OR=7.88, 95% CI: 3.83–16.23), and preconception mood disorders (OR=2.76, 95% CI: 1.31–5.84) were associated with higher odds of CAD. Conversely, the presence of no or few economic problems (OR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.07–0.65; OR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.09–0.77) and the perception of enough or more than enough practical support from friends or relatives (OR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.13–0.80; OR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.09–0.53) were associated with lower odds of developing CAD.
Limitations
The cross-sectional design; the use of self-report questionnaires.
Conclusion
CAD is relatively common among third-trimester antepartum women. The provision of economic/practical support may reduce CAD prevalence and its direct and indirect costs.}

abstract = {Objective
Increases in stress, anxiety, and depression among women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported internationally. Yet rigorous comparison of the prevalence of maternal mental health problems across countries is lacking. Moreover, whether stress is a common predictor of maternal mental health during the pandemic across countries is unknown.
Methods
8148 pregnant women from Germany, Israel, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States were enrolled in the International COVID-19 Pregnancy Experiences (I-COPE) Study between April 17 and May 31, 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, pandemic-related stress, pregnancy-specific stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed with well-validated instruments. The magnitude of stress and mood disturbances was compared across countries. A path model predicting clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression from maternal characteristics and stress was tested for all study participants and then examined separately in each country with >200 participants.
Results
Countries differed significantly in magnitude of pandemic-related pregnancy stress and pandemic-unrelated pregnancy-specific stress, and in prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression levels. A well-fitting common path model for the entire sample indicated that mood and anxiety disturbances were strongly predicted by pandemic-related and pregnancy-specific stress after accounting for maternal characteristics. The model was replicated in individual countries.
Conclusions
Although pregnant women in high-income Western countries experienced different levels of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, stress is a strong, common predictor of anxiety and depressive symptoms in these individuals. The common model can be used to inform research and clinical interventions to protect against adverse consequences of prenatal maternal stress, anxiety, and depression for mothers and infants.}

Primary care providers are skilled at screening, diagnosing, and treating the mother for postpartum depression. However, perinatal and postpartum anxiety demonstrates a greater prevalence rate and appears to be under-recognized and under-treated, despite its increased prevalence. With frequent patient encounters during pregnancy and in the postpartum period, nurse practitioners have the opportunity to recognize and treat postpartum anxiety and, as a result, improve patient outcomes for the mother and infant.

abstract = {Background
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely to experience several pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm births than women without polycystic ovary syndrome. However, at present, there is limited research on whether polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with both anxiety and depression during pregnancy and whether this augments a woman’s risk of postpartum depression, particularly among high-risk populations who have limited access to care.
Objective
Our primary objective was to assess the association between prepregnancy polycystic ovary syndrome and postpartum depression, considering important baseline confounding factors. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the mediating role of prenatal depression and anxiety on the association between polycystic ovary syndrome and postpartum depression.
Study Design
This study involved a population-based sample of 3906 postpartum (2–6 months) women who completed the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Phase 8 questionnaire (2016–2018). Weighted adjusted prevalence ratios were used to assess the association between polycystic ovary syndrome and postpartum depression, considering potential confounding factors and assessing mediating effects of depression and anxiety experienced during pregnancy.
Results
Following the exclusion criteria, 8.2% of women reported clinical polycystic ovary syndrome and 19.1%, 6.2%, and 4.4% reported irregular periods and acne, irregular periods and hirsutism, and all 3 symptoms, respectively. Moreover, 17.7% and 23.5% reported experiencing prenatal depression and anxiety and 9.5% and 10.2% reported experiencing postpartum depressed mood and anhedonia, respectively. Clinical polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a 1.76 higher adjusted prevalence ratio (95% confidence interval, 1.03–3.00) for postpartum depressed mood or anhedonia after taking into consideration age, prepregnancy body mass index, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. A similar higher prevalence was seen for irregular periods and acne (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.41), irregular periods and hirsutism (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–2.40), and all 3 symptoms (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–3.19) and postpartum depressed mood or anhedonia. Prenatal depression and anxiety mediated 20% and 32% of the effect of clinical polycystic ovary syndrome on postpartum depressed mood and anhedonia, respectively.
Conclusion
Clinical polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with postpartum depressed mood and symptoms among this population-based sample inclusive of high-risk mothers. Prenatal depression and anxiety mediate this association, emphasizing the importance of prenatal psychological screening among women with polycystic ovary syndrome. An additional important clinical and public health implication of this study lies in the finding that nearly 20% of women in this population-based sample who reported at least 2 polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms (including at-risk women who may not have access to care) had not received a clinical diagnosis for polycystic ovary syndrome.}

abstract = {Objective
Literature underlines that the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is the most common measure to assess postpartum depression (PPD) worldwide and suggests that the rate of false positives is high. Furthermore, the EPDS does not distinguish between depression and anxiety. This study describes different definitions of PPD and whether pregnancy anxiety disorders are risk factors for different PPDs at both 1month and 1year postpartum.
Method
1066 women were recruited during pregnancy and followed until the 12th month postpartum (N=500). Women were administered the SCID and completed the PDPI-R during pregnancy. During the postpartum women who had an EPDS score of 13 or more were administered the SCID to distinguish minor or major depressive episodes (mMD) from false positives.
Results
41.5% and 44.9% of the PPD assessed with the EPDS were false positives at the 1st month and during the 1st year postpartum respectively. The difference observed in prevalence rates estimated with EPDS and SCID was statistically significant both at the 1st month and during the 1st year postpartum. Overall the effect of anxiety diagnoses in predicting PPD was stronger at the 1st month than during the 1st year postpartum. The role of panic disorder is associated both with probable depression (ES=0.82) and with mMD (ES=0.87) at the 1st month postpartum, and predicted mMD during the 1st year postpartum (ES=0.71). OCD predicted false positives at the 1st month postpartum (ES=0.89).
Conclusion
An antenatal screening of specific anxiety diagnoses could be extremely useful for the prevention of possible postpartum distress outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Family history is a major risk factor for child problem behaviour, yet few studies have examined the association between grandparental psychiatric disorder and child problem behaviour. Results are inconsistent as to whether the effect of grandparental depression on child problem behaviour is independent of parental psychopathology.
Methods
Mothers and their children participated in an ethnically Dutch subcohort of a population-based prospective cohort in the Netherlands. N=816 (66%) mothers and n=691 fathers participated in the prenatal interviews. N=687 (84%) mothers and children and n=565 (82%) fathers participated three years postpartum. (Grand)parental psychopathology was assessed during pregnancy of the mothers with the Family Informant Schedule and Criteria (FISC), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Child behaviour was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by mother and father when the child was three years old.
Results
Grandparental anxiety disorder predicted maternal reports of children's internalizing problems (OR=1.98, 95% C.I. (1.20, 3.28), p-value<0.01) and externalizing problems (OR=1.73, 95% C.I. (1.04, 2.87), p-value=0.03), independent of parental psychopathology. Results were similar for grandparental depression; internalizing OR=1.75, 95% C.I (1.11, 2.75), p-value=0.02 and externalizing OR=1.67, 95% C.I. (1.05, 2.64) p-value=0.03. However, grandparental psychopathology was not associated with children's problem behaviour as reported by the father.
Limitations
Information on grandparental lifetime psychiatric disorder was assessed through a parental interview which may have led to an underestimation of the prevalence rates.
Conclusions
These results confirm the importance of a family history including not only the parental but also the grandparental generations.}

abstract = {Objective
We aimed to analyze the changing level of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women, with and without high-risk indicators separately, in a tertiary care center serving also for COVID-19 patients, in the capital of Turkey.
Study design
We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited.
Results
There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p < 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.}

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health problem worldwide, which adversely affects maternal and infant health. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and related factors of postpartum depression in Chinese puerperium women.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Baoan Maternal and Child Health Hospital located in the west of Shenzhen, China. The Chinese version of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to screen PPD. A score of ≥10 was used as the threshold of postpartum depression.
Results
A total of 4813 puerperal women were included in this study, 11.5% of whom were considered to have PPD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that family history of mental illness (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.05-3.57; P = 0.033), living with parents-in-law (OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16-1.72; P < 0.001), anxiety during pregnancy (OR = 3.66; 95% CI, 2.97-4. 52; P < 0.001), depression during pregnancy (OR = 4.25; 95% CI, 3.28-5.50; P < 0.001), and stressful life events (OR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.03-2.20; P = 0.036) were associated with the high prevalence of PPD.
Limitations
The cross-sectional survey cannot assess direct causality. EPDS is just a screening tool and not a diagnostic one.
Conclusion
Postpartum depression is a common disease in Chinese puerperal population. High-risk pregnant women with postpartum depression need routine screening and targeted intervention for PPD.}

abstract = {Background
Postpartum anxiety (PPA) affects a substantial number of women. Despite increasing recognition of PPA, few studies have focused on perinatal anxiety and potential PPA triggers. Here we aimed to estimate the prevalence of perinatal anxiety disorders, and to explore the association between insomnia during late pregnancy and anxiety before and after childbirth.
Methods
This study was part of the large population-based Akershus Birth Cohort. We analyzed data from the hospital's birth records and questionnaire responses from pregnancy weeks 17 and 32 and postpartum week 8 (n = 1563). Perinatal anxiety symptoms were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Anxiety disorder measurements were based on questions from the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Insomnia was measured using the Bergen Insomnia Scale.
Results
Among perinatal women, 10% reported symptoms of at least one anxiety disorder. The observed prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder was higher after delivery (4.2%) than during pregnancy (2.5%). Multiple regression analysis, with adjustment for several psychosocial and reproductive variables, indicated that insomnia during pregnancy was significantly associated with postpartum anxiety symptoms. However, this association was markedly weakened when depression variables were included in the analysis, indicating that gestational insomnia may also be a marker for a mood disorder.
Limitations
Immigrant and single women were underrepresented in our sample.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that anxiety disorders are prevalent during the perinatal period. Moreover, insomnia during pregnancy is associated with perinatal anxiety. Health professionals should be aware that women with gestational insomnia may have an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders.}

Women suffering from MDD during pregnancy use antidepressant medications, particularly Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). These drugs readily cross the placental barrier and impact the developing fetal brain. The present study assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to fluoxetine (FLX), an SSRI antidepressant drug, on corticosterone and behavioral responses to stress in female mice. In young females, prenatal FLX significantly elevated corticosterone response to continuous stress. In adults, prenatal FLX augmented corticosterone response to acute stress and suppressed the response to continuous stress. Additionally, prenatal FLX significantly augmented stress-induced increase in locomotion and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in adult, but not young mice. The dexamethasone suppression test revealed that prenatal FLX induced a state of glucocorticoid resistance in adult females, indicating that the negative feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress was disrupted. These findings provide the first indication of altered hormonal and behavioral responses to continuous stress and suggest a role for the development of glucocorticoid resistance in these effects. According to these findings, prenatal environment may have implications for stress sensitivity and responsiveness to life challenges. Furthermore, this study may assist in understanding the limitations and precautions that should be taken in the use of SSRIs during pregnancy.}

keywords = {Resilience, Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Pregnant women},
abstract = {Background
Prenatal anxiety/depression has been a major public health problem globally with higher prevalence in developing countries, which leads to negative health outcomes for both mothers and children. Maternal stress varies over the course of pregnancy and the stress occurring in early pregnancy is the most critical. However, few studies have focused on the impact of resilience to stress on mental health of pregnant women.
Aims
To explore the effect of resilience to stress on prenatal anxiety/depression in pregnant women.
Methods
2813 participants were recruited from Shanghai Maternal-Child Pairs Cohort (Shanghai MCPC) in this study. The Life Event Scale for Pregnancy Women (LESPW) was used to assess stress at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy and at 32–36 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Resilience was assessed by the revised Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) at 12–16 weeks of pregnancy. The prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed at 32–26 weeks of pregnancy by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Survey, Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the direct effect of stress and resilience on prenatal anxiety and depression. The indirect effects of mediation were analyzed by structural equation models, and the indirect effect of modification was examined by stratification analysis.
Results
There were 11.1% and 10.3% of pregnant women in Shanghai MCPC indicating anxiety and depressive mood, respectively. The stress caused by both subjective and objective events at 32–36 weeks of pregnancy is less than that at 12–16weeks of pregnancy. We found that resilience was a protective factor for maternal mental health and meanwhile it was both an effect modifier and a mediator to the association between stress and prenatal anxiety/depression, with the mediating effect ratio of 15.1% and 23.8%, respectively.
Limitations
The existence of recall bias, missing data, and restricted residential areas of the participants may limit the generalizability of the study. The measurements of resilience, prenatal anxiety, and depression were not designed specifically for pregnant women, so that they might have missed some important indications of mental issues related to pregnant women only.
Conclusions
Resilience could be a direct and indirect protective factor for prenatal anxiety and depression caused by pregnancy stress.}

abstract = {Objectives
to investigate the prevalence of depression during pregnancy and postpartum period for Jordanian women and identify associated risk factors and maternity service delivery issues.
Design
a prospective cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited during the last trimester of pregnancy, provided personal, social and obstetric information, and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS), the Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale (PSES) and Perceived Knowledge Scale (PKS). All participants were contacted again at six–eight weeks and six months post partum to complete a telephone or face-to-face interview. The postnatal questionnaire included the EPDS, MSSS, and DASS-21.
Setting
a teaching hospital and five health centres in Irbid city in northern Jordan.
Participants
Arabic speaking women (n=353) between the ages of 18 and 45 years, in their last trimester of pregnancy, at low risk for obstetric complications and receiving antenatal care between November 2005 and August 2006.
Findings
high rates of antenatal (19%) and postnatal depression (22%) were reported. A regression analysis revealed that stress, anxiety, financial problems, perceived lack of parenting knowledge, difficult relationship with the mother-in-law, unplanned pregnancy, and low self-efficacy were associated with antenatal depression. These seven factors accounted for 83% (r2=0.834) of variance in the development of probable antenatal depression. At six–eight weeks post partum, a regression analysis revealed that antenatal depression, unplanned pregnancy, difficult relationship with mother-in-law, dissatisfaction with overall care, stress, lack of social support, giving birth to a female baby, feeling pressured to birth the baby quickly, and perceived low parenting knowledge were associated with postnatal depression. These nine variables accounted for 82% (r2=0.819) of variance in the development of probable PND. Three intrapartum and postpartum variables associated with PND at six–eight weeks (postpartum haemorrhage, unhelpful doctors during labour and birth, and anxiety) were no longer associated with PND at six months.
Conclusions and implications for practice
Jordanian women need support to prepare for labour and birth. Postpartum emotional support and assessment of symptoms of depression needs to be incorporated into routine practice. The opportunity for open discussion along with increased awareness and clarification of common misconceptions about antenatal and postnatal depression are necessary. Quality assurance systems would help reduce the rate of invasive obstetric procedures, and give greater emphasis to emotional care provided to women during the perinatal period.}

Methods
A cross-sectional survey with 1204 women who had a healthy and term birth in a baby-friendly hospital, Shanghai, China. PPA and PPD symptoms were measured by using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
Results
The mean score of SAS and EPDS was 40.79 ± 8.48 and 8.18 ± 5.80, respectively. The estimated prevalence of PPA and PPD symptoms was 15.2% and 23.2%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of fatigue and PPD symptoms were risk factors for PPA symptoms, whereas having support from family and being satisfied with labor experience were protective factors. In terms of PPD symptoms, its risk factors included smoking before pregnancy, maternal separation from baby, fatigue, encountering difficulties in breastfeeding, and the presence of PPA symptoms. In contrast, the protective factors for PPD symptoms were having support from family and having support from colleagues or friends.
Limitations
Convenience sampling and voluntary participation may have led to a selection bias.
Conclusion
PPA and PPD symptoms occur commonly among parturients in Shanghai, China. The findings from this research provide a better understanding of factors associated with PPA and PPD symptoms and will help guide personalized approaches to the management of postpartum anxiety and depression.}

Previous studies have shown an association between prepregnancy BMI and postpartum depression, but little is known about this association beyond one year postpartum and the influence of postpartum weight retention (PPWR).
Methods
We used data from 70355 mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort to estimate the associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and PPWR, respectively, and incident depression/anxiety disorders until six years postpartum. Outcome was depression or anxiety diagnosed clinically or filling a prescription for an antidepressant. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Follow-up started at the day of delivery. For the analysis regarding PPWR, follow-up started six months postpartum.
Results
Underweight, overweight and obesity were associated with depression and/or anxiety disorders when compared to normal-weight, though the associations were attenuated after adjustments (HR 1.24 [95% CI 1.06–1.45], 1.05 [95% CI 0.96–1.15] and 1.07 [95% CI 0.95–1.21] for underweight, overweight and obese, respectively). Compared to mothers who had returned to their prepregnancy BMI, risk of depression/anxiety disorders was increased for mothers, who from prepregnancy to 6 months postpartum experienced either weight loss >1 BMI unit (HR 1.19 [95% CI 1.06–1.25]), weight gain of 2–3 BMI units (HR 1.23 [95% CI 1.08–1.40]), or weight gain of ≥3 BMI units (HR 1.21 [95% CI 1.05–1.40]).
Limitation
Causal direction and mechanisms behind the associations are largely unknown.
Conclusions
Low prepregnancy body weight and postpartum weight gain or loss are associated with occurrence of depression and anxiety disorders.}

abstract = {Background
Low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden of preterm birth (PTB) and low infant birth weight (LBW) complications where affective and anxiety disorders are more common in the antepartum period than in industrialized countries.
Objective
To evaluate the extent to which early pregnancy antepartum depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with infant birth weight and gestational age at delivery among a cohort of pregnant women in Peru.
Methods
Our prospective cohort study consisted of 4408 pregnant women. Antepartum depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD were assessed in early pregnancy using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and PTSD Checklist – Civilian Version, respectively. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear and logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted measures of association (β coefficients and odds ratios) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
After adjusting for confounders, women with antepartum generalized anxiety (32.6% prevalence) had higher odds of LBW (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.47; 95%CI: 1.10–1.95) and were more likely to deliver small for gestational age (OR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.01–1.92) infants compared to those without anxiety. Compared to those without PTSD, women with PTSD (34.5%) had higher odds of delivering preterm (OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 1.00–1.65) yet PTSD was not associated with LBW nor gestational age at delivery. Women with antepartum depression (26.2%) were at no increased risk of delivering a preterm, low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant.
Limitations
Our ability to make casual inferences from this observational study is limited; however, these findings are consistent with prior studies.
Conclusion
Generalized anxiety disorder during pregnancy appeared to increase odds of delivering a low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infant, while PTSD was associated with increased odds of delivering preterm. Our findings, and those of others, suggest antenatal care should be tailored to screen for and provide additional mental health services to patients.}

abstract = {Background
Antenatal depression has been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and threatened miscarriage is often seen clinically to impact adversely on maternal wellbeing, notwithstanding the limited research evidence. Our study aims to examine the link between threatened miscarriage and antenatal depression and anxiety in an Asian obstetric population.
Methods
We recruited 121 women and 68 partners facing threatened miscarriage, and 241 women and 180 partners experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies from a tertiary maternity hospital in Singapore. All participants completed a Patient Information Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
Results
The proportion of women with major depressive and anxiety symptomatology was significantly higher among women facing threatened miscarriage compared to those with stable pregnancies (depressive: 33.1% vs. 17.0%, p = 0.008; anxiety: 48.8% vs. 23.7%, p < 0.0001). Amongst their partners, there was a non-significant trend towards a similar finding (depressive: 10.3% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.439; anxiety: 23.5% vs. 18.9%, p = 0.478). Threatened miscarriage remained significantly associated with major depressive symptomatology after adjusting for potential confounders among women (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.55, 4.71; p < 0.0001) but not among their partners (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.56, 3.87; p = 0.430).
Limitations
This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size for male partners.
Conclusion
Antenatal depressive and anxiety symptomatology affects one in four women in their first trimester, with even higher prevalence among women facing threatened miscarriage. Targeted depression and anxiety screening that includes women facing threatened miscarriages may facilitate early and efficient detection and management of mental health problems among pregnant women.}

abstract = {Background
Infertility, and fertility treatment, are associated with psychological distress that may influence subsequent mental health including postpartum depression and anxiety.
Methods
Data for women who had a livebirth between 1991 and 2013 were drawn from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Conception history prior to their first recorded birth was categorised as ‘no fertility problems’, ‘untreated subfertility’, ovulation induction (OI), and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Depression and/or anxiety in the 12 months postpartum were identified using records of diagnoses, symptoms, and prescriptions. Prevalence was compared, and odds ratios estimated using multivariable logistic regression.
Results
Of 235,127 mothers, 31,947 (13.6%) had evidence of postpartum depression and/or anxiety. Mothers in the ART group had 22% lower odds of postnatal depression and/or anxiety compared to mothers in the fertile group (OR 0.78; 95% CI [0.70–0.86]; p < 0.0001). Accounting for prior mental health, lifestyle, sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors reduced the strength of the association (aOR 0.87; 95% CI [0.78–0.97]; p = 0.01). There were no significant associations observed in the untreated subfertility or OI groups.
Limitations
As in any analysis of routine data, the quality of recording is important and some information was unavailable (e.g. education, social support).
Conclusions
Women with a history of subfertility, OI or ART treatment were not at increased risk of postpartum depression and/or anxiety compared to those with no fertility problems. It is important to explore whether women who underwent ART are less likely to experience depression/anxiety or do not seek help when needed, with implications for their health and care.}

abstract = {Résumé
L’accouchement des primipares est parfois associé à des douleurs sévères qui pourraient prédisposer les mères à développer des symptômes anxieux et dépressifs.
But de l’étude
Évaluer la prévalence de la dépression du post-partum chez les primipares, déterminer les facteurs favorisant la survenue de ce trouble psychiatrique et étudier le lien entre la douleur de l’accouchement et la dépression du post-partum.
Patients et méthode
Nous avons mené une étude prospective et longitudinale, incluant 183 femmes primipares. Notre étude s’est déroulée en deux temps. Dans un premier temps qui correspond aux 48 premières heures suivant l’accouchement, nous avons évalué la douleur ressentie pendant l’accouchement en utilisant le « Questionnaire Douleur Saint-Antoine (QDSA) ». Dans un deuxième temps, soit 6 à 8 semaines après l’accouchement, nous avons utilisé l’Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) et L’échelle « Hospital Anxiety And Depression Scale (HADS) » pour évaluer les symptômes anxieux et dépressifs.
Résultats
Le score moyen total obtenu au « Questionnaire Douleur Saint-Antoine » était de 74,44 avec un score moyen de 45,01 pour la douleur sensorielle et de 29,44 pour la douleur émotionnelle. Un état dépressif a été diagnostiqué chez 18,7 % des mères. Les scores obtenus à l’échelle EPDS étaient significativement plus élevés chez les primipares en cas de grossesse non désirée, d’accouchement par voie basse, d’accouchement instrumental, d’accouchement compliqué et lorsque la relation conjugale était considérée comme conflictuelle. Vingt pour cent des mères remplissaient les critères d’un état anxieux au moment de l’étude. Des scores d’anxiété significativement plus élevés ont été retrouvés chez les mères célibataires, celles ayant un faible niveau socioéconomique ou un faible niveau d’éducation, en cas d’accouchement par voie basse, lorsque le sexe du bébé n’était pas désiré et lorsque la qualité du lien conjugal et le contact avec l’équipe soignante étaient jugés de mauvaise qualité. Des scores plus élevés de douleur de l’accouchement étaient associés à des scores de dépression et d’anxiété plus élevés.
Conclusion
Il semble ainsi judicieux d’évaluer la douleur de l’accouchement, d’améliorer sa prise en charge en envisagent des stratégies de gestion et d’accompagnement de la douleur et de sensibiliser les professionnels de santé aux troubles anxieux et dépressifs du post-partum.
Childbirth of primiparous women is sometimes associated with severe pain that could predispose mothers to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Objective
To assess the prevalence of postpartum depression among primiparous women, to determine risk factors that can contribute to this psychiatric disorder and to study the links between labor pain and postpartum depression.
Methods
To that end, we conducted a prospective and longitudinal study, including 183 primiparous women. In the first step, corresponding to the first 48hours after delivery, we assessed pain experienced during childbirth using the “Saint-Antoine Pain Questionnaire”. In the second phase, 6 to 8 weeks after delivery, we used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Results
The average total score on the “Saint-Antoine Pain Questionnaire” was 74.44, with an average score of 45.01 for sensory pain and that of 29.44 for emotional pain. A depressive state was diagnosed in 18.7% of mothers. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were significantly higher among primiparous women in case of an unwanted pregnancy, vaginal delivery, instrumental delivery, complicated childbirth and when the marital relationship was considered to be conflictual. An anxiety state was objectified in 20% of women. Significantly higher anxiety scores were found in single mothers, those with a low socioeconomic level, those with a low level of education, in case of a vaginal delivery, when the sex of the baby was unwanted and when the quality of the marital bond and the contact with the healthcare team were judged to be of poor quality. Higher childbirth pain scores were associated with significantly higher scores of depression and anxiety. Moreover, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were significantly higher in primiparous mothers with higher scores of anxiety (P<0.001).
Conclusion
It seems judicious to assess the childbirth pain, to improve its management by support strategies and to make health professionals aware of postpartum anxiety and depression disorders.}

Pregnancy during adolescence is a risk factor for adverse medical and psychosocial outcomes, including psychiatric illness. Psychiatric illness is linked with obstetric complications along with impaired maternal functioning in the postpartum period. This article provides a comprehensive review of the research examining the intersection of psychopathology and adolescent pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Design
A literature search was conducted using PubMed (Medline), PsycINFO, and CINAHL for articles published between 1990 and 2013 that examined depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and psychosis during pregnancy and the postpartum period in adolescents age 21 years or younger. Articles were selected that covered the following topics: Prevalence or incidence, comorbidity, psychosocial correlates, birth outcomes, parenting, child outcomes, and psychosocial treatment. Forty articles were found and reviewed.
Results
There is a substantial research base examining self-reported depressive symptoms in adolescents during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Existing research suggests that pregnant and parenting adolescents are at greater risk for experiencing depressive symptoms than pregnant and postpartum adult women. Depression in the perinatal period is also a risk factor for substance and alcohol abuse and a harsher parenting style in adolescents. Areas for future research in this population include investigating the prevalence, psychosocial correlates, and outcomes of clinically diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder, developing and empirically validating psychotherapeutic treatments, and focusing upon other psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder, anxiety, and psychosis.}

abstract = {Objective
This prospective study investigated associations between maternal stress exposure and maternal psychological stress measures during pregnancy with obstetric and neonatal outcomes. We also tested whether any observed associations would be moderated by increasing glucose levels, as increased glycaemia is also associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
Methods
203 women between 24 and 30 weeks gestation completed validated questionnaires assessing pregnancy-related major events and major life events, maternal perceived stress, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Glucose was measured using fasting morning blood samples. Instrumental delivery represented an obstetric outcome. Neonatal outcomes included Apgar score, large and small for gestational age weight, cord blood pH, NICU hospitalization, and neonatal hypoglycaemia.
Results
Regarding the obstetric outcome, pregnancy-related major life events OR = 1.346 (1.016–1.783; p = .016) were related to more incidences of instrumental delivery. Regarding neonatal outcomes, exposure to major life events in the last 12 months was associated with lower cord blood pH values B = -0.155 (−0.059 to −0.002; p = .036) and with more incidences of hypoglycaemia OR = 0.165 (0.012–0.169; p = .04). Maternal psychological stress measures were related to more incidences of instrumental delivery OR = 1.018 (1.003–1.032; p = .013). Maternal stress perception was associated with higher cord blood pH values B = 0.155 (0–0.003; p = .046) and fewer NICU hospitalisations OR = −0.170 (−0.009 to −0.001; p = .019). Some of these associations between life events and stress perceptions with neonatal outcomes were moderated by fasting glucose levels.
Conclusion
Maternal pregnancy events as well as stress, depression and anxiety symptoms have a negative impact on obstetric outcomes and maternal life events are associated with negative neonatal outcomes. Higher fasting glucose levels moderate some of the relationships between stress and neonatal outcomes.}

Data were collected during pregnancy (timepoint 1, during France's first period of lockdown from April 6th to May 11th, 2020) and then one month after childbirth (timepoint 2). At timepoint 1, 90 women completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. At timepoint 2, 26 women completed the City Birth Trauma Scale, the Interpersonal Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. The relationship between social support and worry about the fetus/baby during the COVID-19 pandemic was statistically significant (Rho=- 0.21; p0.05). Worry about the fetus/baby was also significantly correlated with the anxiety score (Rho=0.60; p0.01) and the depression score (Rho= 0.37, p0.01). When the study population was compared with a control sample of new mothers having given birth outside the lockdown period, we observed differences in the prevalence of anxiety but not in the prevalence of postpartum PTSD. Lastly, the relationship between posttraumatic growth and emotion regulation was not significant (Rho=0.29, p = 0.16 for soothing; Rho=0.26, p = 0.20 for social modeling; Rho=0.28; p = 0.17 for perspective-taking; Rho=0.35; p = 0.08 for enhancing positive affect). In view of the sample size and the statistical tests, this study should be considered as exploratory. Our present results open up opportunities for further research and suggest that a possible impact of COVID-19 must be considered when evaluating potential psychological disorders in the perinatal period.}

This study focused on postpartum women, who are one of the most vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to reveal mental health consequences of social restrictions, loss of social support, and loss of autonomy.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study for postpartum women in October 2020 in Japan (N = 600). The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure postpartum depression. The prevalence ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression models, adjusting for age, education, household income, residential area, parity, the timing of delivery, and a prior history of depression.
Results
The prevalence of postpartum depression was 28.7% (EPDS ≥9, which is frequently used in Japan), 18.6% (≥11), and 13.1% (≥13). Social restrictions, including cancellation of home visits by healthcare professionals and cancellation of infant checkups or vaccinations, loss of support during pregnancy or after delivery, including loss of opportunities to consult with healthcare professionals or friends and cancellation of parents or other family members' visits to support, and loss of autonomy about delivery or breastfeeding, were associated with postnatal depression.
Conclusions
At least 13% of women who delivered and raised babies during the COVID-19 pandemic had postpartum depressive symptoms. COVID-19 related social restrictions and loss of social support from healthcare professionals, families, and friends were significantly associated with postpartum depression. In addition, loss of maternal autonomy in delivery and breastfeeding was associated with postpartum depression. The results indicate that both formal and informal support should not be limited to preventing postpartum depression during a pandemic.}

: When anxiety and depression are comorbid (CAD), symptoms are more severe and the response to treatments is worse. Given the links between mood disorders and poor perinatal outcomes, CAD and its correlates deserve special clinical attention during pregnancy. The main objective of this study was to learn about the prevalence of comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) in early stages of the pregnancy analyzing the relationship between CAD and cultural and sociodemographic factors.
Methods
: We have studied a multicultural sample of 514 Turkish and Spanish pregnant women (264 in Málaga, 102 in Istambul and 148 in Antalya) recruited at the moment of their first pregnancy medical check-up between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. These women completed a questionnaire that included the Turkish or Spanish validated versions of the Edinburg postnatal depression scale (EDS), the state and trait anxiety scale (STAI) and a series of questions related to health status, general mood, and sociodemographic variables.
Results
We found a CAD prevalence rate of 26.9% and a significant higher prevalence rate among Turkish women (47.6%) when compared to Spanish participants (9.5%) (p<0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that the lack of someone who provided emotional support was the variable that best predicted CAD symptoms.
Conclusion

abstract = {Background
Untreated depression and anxiety during the perinatal period have significant consequences on maternal and infant health; however, few studies have examined perinatal depression and perinatal anxiety in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The current study prospectively examined the prevalence of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety, and emotional support from family and friends, as well as childhood sexual abuse in women with and without HIV infection.
Methods
Between July 2009 and January 2013, 258 pregnant women receiving care in a Philadelphia hospital were enrolled, with 162 completing both the prenatal and postpartum portions of the study. The Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults were used to measure depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. An independent samples t test and multiple linear regressions were used to determine associations among depression, anxiety, and pregnancy-related variables.
Results
Forty-nine participants (30%) were living with HIV; 113 (70%) were HIV negative. CES-D scores did not differ prenatally (p = .131) or postpartum (p = .156) between women with and without HIV. Prenatal state anxiety scores were higher in women with HIV (p = .02) but there were no differences postpartum (p = .432). In a multiple linear regression, trait anxiety predicted postpartum anxiety in the full sample (p < .001) and childhood sexual abuse predicted postpartum depression among women with HIV (p = .021).
Conclusions
These findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating perinatal depression and anxiety early in the prenatal period. Results also emphasize the need for providers to be aware of childhood sexual abuse as a potential correlate for depression in women with HIV.}

abstract = {Purpose
Depression, stress, and anxiety, termed ‘psychological distress,’ are common in pregnancy and postpartum periods. However, it is unclear whether prenatal psychological distress predicts postpartum psychological distress. We studied the prevalence, comorbidity and associations of maternal depression, stress, and anxiety in the prenatal period in relation to the occurrence of these same measures in the postpartum period.
Methods
Data originated from the MotherToBaby study of pregnant women residing in the U.S or Canada (2016–2018). Risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals using modified-Poisson regression models were used to investigate associations between prenatal psychological distress and postpartum psychological distress.
Results
Of the 288 women in the analysis, 21.2% and 26.7% of women had evidence of prenatal and postnatal psychological distress, respectively. Among those with prenatal psychological distress, 43 (70.5%) also had postpartum psychological distress. Twenty-five (41%) of those with prenatal and 46 (60%) of those with postpartum psychological distress had comorbidity of at least two of the measures. Prenatal measures independently predicted the same postnatal measures; prenatal anxiety also independently predicted postpartum stress. Participants who experienced more types of prenatal psychological distress were at higher risk for postpartum depression, stress, and anxiety.
Conclusion
Depression, stress, and anxiety are common in pregnant women and often occur together. Prenatal psychological distress measures are associated with postnatal psychological distress measures, with stronger associations among women with more than one type of psychological distress in pregnancy. Interventions during pregnancy may reduce the risk of postpartum psychological distress.}

abstract = {Background
As mental healthcare expands to web-apps, smartphones, and other technologies, it is important to understand the psychological profiles of women who self-select to participate in perinatal mental health digital platform randomized control trials. There are concerns that those seeking internet-based mental health treatments may not be representative of the general perinatal populations seeking face-to-face treatments resulting in a lack of generalizability. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic and psychological profiles of prenatal women seeking treatment over the internet for mental health concerns as compared to the general perinatal population seeking mental health treatments.
Methods
This was a descriptive study involving pregnant women across Alberta, Canada, aged 18–47 years old. Profiles were collected through self-report baseline demographics and mental health information using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Antenatal Risk Questionnaire (ANRQ), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)- Anxiety and Stress Subscales, and Maclean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD).
Results
A total of 887 women completed self-reported baseline demographic data and 590 women completed baseline mental health data. Mean age of women was 31.3 years with a mean pregnancy gestational age of 15.3 weeks). A history of depression was reported by 36.3%, a history of anxiety was reported by 20.8% of women, and a history of abuse and emotional abuse was reported in 27.7% and 23.5% of women. At baseline, 57.6% of women had clinically significant mental health risk scores, 24.3% of women had probable minor depression, and mild to moderate levels of anxiety were reported in 23.2% of women. Borderline personality disorder was reported by 12.5% of women.
Conclusions
Overall, this sample of pregnant women has prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress that are comparable to those rates found in pregnant women in the general population. This suggests that there is broad utility for and consumer interest in internet-based mental health treatments.}

abstract = {Background
Early pregnancy losses are common, but their psychologic sequelae are often overlooked. Previous studies have established links between miscarriage and early symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the incidence of posttraumatic stress symptoms and the psychologic response specifically to ectopic pregnancies have not been investigated.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate levels of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety in women in the 9 months after early pregnancy loss, with a focus on miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Morbidity at 1 month was compared with a control group in healthy pregnancy.
Study Design
This was a prospective cohort study. Consecutive women were recruited from the early pregnancy and antenatal clinics at 3 London hospitals and received emailed surveys that contained standardized psychologic assessments that included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Posttraumatic stress Diagnostic Scale, at 1, 3, and 9 months after loss. Control subjects were assessed after a dating scan. We assessed the proportion of participants who met the screening criteria for posttraumatic stress and moderate/severe anxiety or depression. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios.
Results
Seven hundred thirty-seven of 1098 women (67%) with early pregnancy loss (including 537 miscarriages and 116 ectopic pregnancies) and 171 of 187 control subjects (91%) agreed to participate. Four hundred ninety-two of the women with losses (67%) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale after 1 month; 426 women (58%) completed it after 3 months, and 338 women (46%) completed it after 9 months. Eighty-seven control subjects (51%) participated. Criteria for posttraumatic stress were met in 29% of women with early pregnancy loss after 1 month and in 18% after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.89). Moderate/severe anxiety was reported in 24% after 1 month and in 17% after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.50–0.94). Moderate/severe depression was reported in 11% of the women after 1 month and 6% of the women after 9 months (odds ratio per month, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.44). After miscarriage, proportions after 9 months were 16% for posttraumatic stress, 17% for anxiety, and 5% for depression. Corresponding figures after ectopic pregnancy were 21%, 23%, and 11%, respectively. In contrast, among control women with viable pregnancies, 13% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety (odds ratio loss at 1 month vs controls: 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–4.36), and 2% reported moderate-to-severe depression (odds ratio loss at 1 month vs control subjects: 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27–19.2).
Conclusion
Women experience high levels of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression after early pregnancy loss. Distress declines over time but remains at clinically important levels at 9 months.}

We aimed to analyze the validity and reliability of the PreOCS Portuguese version and to describe the prevalence, content, severity, interference, and onset of OC symptoms in pregnancy. Three hundred fifty-five pregnant women completed the PreOCS and other self-report instruments to evaluate perinatal anxiety and depression. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a second-order model presented an acceptable fit. Cronbach's alphas were ≥.75 for the Severity and the Interference subscales and both were moderately correlated with depression and anxiety measures. Nearly 10% of the women presented OC symptoms with relevant severity. Co-occurrence of obsessions and compulsions (44.4%) was associated with significantly higher PreOCS scores. Obsessions about contamination, harm to the baby, others' judgment and baby's health presented the highest prevalence and increased the odds of having at least one compulsion. Searching for information, asking for reassurance, checking, and cleaning were the most reported compulsions. The Portuguese version of PreOCS has good psychometric properties, presenting itself as a valid and reliable instrument.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence on whether anxiety or mood disorders increases the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) has been conflicting. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of maternal mental disorders over time and their associations with HDP.
Methods
This was a population-based retrospective study involving 9,097,355 pregnant women using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) data from 2004 through 2014. We calculated the prevalence of maternal anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and mood disorder and trends of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia during the study period. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between each mental disorder and HDP.
Results
Mental disorders showed increasing trends among pregnant women, with anxiety showing the greatest increase in rates. Unadjusted associations suggest all mental disorders increase the likelihood of HDP. When adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, only anxiety showed consistently increased risk of gestational hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.324, 95% CI 1.255-1.397), preeclampsia (aOR 1.522, 95% CI 1.444-1.604), with the strongest association with eclampsia (aOR 1.813, 95% CI 1.260-2.610).
Limitations
Information on medication use is not available in the HCUP-NIS database and might have been contributory to our findings.
Conclusions
Rates of maternal psychopathology are rising in the United States. Our study suggests that pregnant women with anxiety are at increased risk of HDP. Targeted screening for mental disorders as possible clinical risk markers may allow for timely prophylaxis and surveillance for the development of HDP.}

Are maternal depression and/or anxiety disorders (MDAD) before and during pregnancy associated with IVF outcomes?
Design
A total of 5661 women starting their first IVF cycle between 15 August 2014 and 31 December 2015 were pooled from a prospective cohort of IVF-conceived children. The self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) were used to determine MDAD. IVF outcomes were compared between MDAD+ and MDAD– groups.
Results
A total of 10.3% (572/5556) of women had MDAD before IVF (bMDAD). The fertilization rate was lower in the bMDAD+ group (59.41 ± 22.11% versus 61.72 ± 22.18%, Padjust < 0.05). No difference was found in the other IVF outcomes. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with singleton live births were similar between the two groups. A total of 17.4% (347) women with singleton live births had MDAD during the first trimester (pMDAD). Birthweight (3383 ± 556 g versus 3447 ± 518 g, Padjust < 0.05) was lower and incidence of low birthweight (LBW) (6.9% versus 3.3%, Padjust < 0.01) was higher in the pMDAD group. After adjustment for potential confounders (gestational age, maternal age, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, threatened abortion, hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus), pMDAD remained significantly associated with LBW (odds ratio [OR] 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–5.42, Padjust < 0.05). The preconception psychological state in the pMDAD group did not demonstrate any additional impact on neonatal outcomes.

MDAD during the first trimester is associated with increased risk of LBW in offspring, whether preconception MDAD exists or not.}

Logistic regression models were used to examine the association of depressive symptoms with baseline socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial indicators.
Results
The prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms, using a cut-off of EDS score ≥ 10, was 20.1%. Depressive symptoms were reported more by women of lower family income and had self-reported history of depression prior to pregnancy, with women in the third trimester having higher odds of antenatal depressive symptoms compared to those in the second trimester. Pregnancy-related anxiety, higher perceived stress levels, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were comorbid with the presence of depressive symptoms.
Conclusion
The findings showed that one in five pregnant women in Kuwait experiences antenatal depressive symptoms and that these symptoms are comorbid with other mental health problems. Screening for antenatal depression and providing support to pregnant women should be considered.}

The study investigates the prevalence of Panic Disorder (PD) with or without comorbid Major (MD) or Minor Depressive (md) disorder during pregnancy and focuses its attention on the different pattern of risk factors in these two subgroups in a sample of women attending two Centres for Prenatal Care of the Public Health Service.
Methods
Two-hundred and seventy-seven pregnant women were assessed monthly throughout the whole pregnancy period using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) for the screening of PD and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the evaluation of severity of anxious and depressive symptoms.
Results
Twenty-one women (7.5%) were diagnosed as affected by PD, of whom 12 (57.1%) showed MD or md comorbidity. The development of PD without depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous episodes of Anxiety Disorders while the development of PD plus depressive comorbidity is predicted by a history of previous depressive episodes and by the lack of familiar support.
Limitations
Given the small sample size of our anxious and depressed women, the present data need to be verified by using larger samples.
Conclusions
The frequent association between PD and MD or md, the analysis of risk factors and of temporal relationship strongly suggests that the panic-depressive comorbidity might represent in fact depressive disorders with intense anxiety symptoms. These findings raise the question if the PD-depressive association is a true comorbidity or reveals the anxious symptomatology of a depressive disorder (MD or md).}

Noise is one of the most important environmental risk factors that adversely affects human health. Residential noise exposure has been associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression in the general population. However, limited study has been conducted in pregnant women.
Objective
To examine the associations of residential noise exposure with prenatal anxiety and depression.
Methods
Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Center for Epidemiological Survey Scale (CES-D) were used to assess the status of prenatal anxiety and depression for 2,018 pregnant women in Shanghai, China. Residential noise exposure was represented by a land use regression model. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the associations of noise exposure with prenatal anxiety and depression.
Results
The prevalence rates of prenatal anxiety and depression were 7.5 % and 8.1 %, respectively. The mean (±standard deviation) residential noise exposure during the whole pregnancy was 60.69 (±3.31) dB (A). Higher residential noise exposure was associated with increased odds of both prenatal anxiety and depression. Compared with low level of noise exposure group (<65 dB(A)), the odds of prenatal anxiety and depression increased 69 % (OR = 1.69, 95 % CI, 1.01–2.82) and 71 % (OR = 1.71, 95 % CI, 1.05–2.80) in higher noise exposure group (≥65 dB(A)), respectively. Stratified analyses showed that the associations were stronger among pregnant women with lower socioeconomic status.

Previous studies on the prevalence and predictors of postpartum depression (PPD) in China were mostly hospital-based with relatively small study samples. Basing on a routine screening programme, this study assessed the prevalence and factors associated with PPD at community level.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted with all the women who delivered in a hospital and were screened for depression during routine postpartum home visits in Shenzhen between 2015 August and 2017 April. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used as the screening tool with a cut-off score of 10. Predictors of PPD were determined by Chi-square test and stepwise logistic regression.
Results
Approximately 300,000 puerperal women were included in the study with a PPD prevalence of 4.3%. Prenatal anxiety and depression were associated with 4.55 and 3.80 times of PPD risk, respectively. Stressful life events, family history of mental illness, poor economic status, low Apgar scores and birth defects of the infants, bottle and mixed feeding, as well as living with parents-in-low after childbirth were related to moderate risk. Higher gravidity and parity, larger gestation age, prenatal education, and living with the women's own parents were associated with lower risk.
Limitations
The large sample size might have suggested statistically significant differences which were not practical.
Conclusions
The prevalence of PPD at community level is significantly lower than the rates detected within hospitals. Prenatal anxiety and depression are the most important predictors of PPD. Integrating depression screening into routine postpartum home visits facilitates achievement of universal coverage.}

The risk factors for depression included drinking (p = 0.04; adjusted OR = 2.81, 95%CI: 1.26~6.24), nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 3.54, 95%CI: 1.10~11.44), pregnancy's influence on mobility (p = 0.02; adjusted OR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.11~1.83), anxiety (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.57~1.75), insomnia (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.14~1.21) and daily attention to fetal movement (p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.31~0.56).
Limitations
This study used a cross-sectional design, and cannot compare changes in the incidence of depression before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
Conclusions
During the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence rate of depression among Chinese prenatal and postnatal women was 35.4%. Moreover, anxiety, insomnia, drinking, nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, as well as the impaired movement and less daily monitoring of fetal movement were risk factors for depression.}

abstract = {Objective
Data on psychiatric morbidity in high-risk pregnant Singaporean women are limited. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of antenatal depression and anxiety in high-risk pregnancies, compare the prevalence of antenatal depression in high-risk pregnancies vs. pregnancies of unspecified obstetric risk and examine the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) as screening tools for these disorders.
Method
Two hundred high-risk pregnant inpatients at a national public maternity hospital were included. Three psychometric assessment tools were used to evaluate all participants: the diagnostic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the screening EPDS and STAI.
Results
Rates of major depression, minor depression, anxiety disorder (agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder), and comorbid depression and anxiety were 11%, 7%, 12.5% and 5%, respectively. Major depression was more prevalent in high-risk pregnancies than in the historical cohort of unspecified obstetric risk (11% versus 4.3%). EPDS (cutoff 8/9) screens well for depression and anxiety in high-risk pregnancies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.82–0.87).
Conclusion
Antenatal depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in a sample of high-risk pregnant Singaporean women. EPDS performs well in screening for depression and anxiety in high-risk pregnant women, with further psychiatric assessment recommended for women with score ≥9.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in Jordanian midwives and identify associated factors.
Design
Setting and participants: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 321 registered midwives from 18 public hospitals in Jordan that provide antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum care, and family planning services. The survey included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and demographic and professional data forms.
Findings
High rates of depression (76.2%); anxiety (85.3%) and stress (66.8%) symptoms were reported among midwives in Jordan. Midwives aged between 22 - 30 years reported more depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms than midwives in the other age groups. Married midwives had higher depression symptoms than single midwives. Midwives with < 10 years in practice had higher depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms compared to midwives with ≥ 10 years in practice. Midwives providing care for > 10 women per shift had higher anxiety and stress symptoms than midwives caring for five or less women per shift. Midwives who rotated between shifts had higher depression and stress symptoms than midwives who did not rotate.
Conclusions
Rates of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms reported by Jordanian midwives were higher than rates reported by midwives in other countries. The high rates of distress highlight the urgent need for national strategies to support the emotional wellbeing and retention of midwives within Jordanian settings.}

abstract = {Pregnancy is a very complex and highly stressful time in which women become more physically and emotionally vulnerable. Therefore, mothers are more likely to face decreased self-esteem and increased postpartum depression. Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, more than 50 % of mothers are undiagnosed or untreated, showing an urgent need to explore an effective preventive strategy. A healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity have been suggested to be associated with an increased quality of life in pregnant and postpartum women. The purpose of this study was to determine whether swimming exercise before and during pregnancy can affect maternal care and postpartum depression-related behaviors in dams. To this end, female NMRI and C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to swimming exercise before conception and throughout pregnancy. On postpartum days 1–2, maternal behavior including nest building, active nursing, and licking/grooming were monitored. A battery of behavioral tests was also used to measure depression-related symptoms including anhedonia- and anxiety-like behavior, social behavior, and behavioral despair. To identify the underlying mechanisms, corticosterone and inflammatory cytokines during late pregnancy, and corticosterone and brain serotonin during the postpartum period were measured in dams. The findings indicated that swimming exercise increased gestational corticosterone, decreased maternal care and brain serotonin, and increased all depression-related behaviors in postpartum C57BL/6 J dams, while only increased licking/grooming and social behavior, and reduced anhedonia-like behavior in postpartum NMRI dams. Taken together, this study suggests that swimming exercise before and during pregnancy could alter maternal care and postpartum depression-like behavior in a strain-dependent manner.}

abstract = {Summary
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder in youth. About a third to one-half of the affected subjects continue to have symptoms in adulthood. Remarkably, the prevalence numbers published for adult females are higher than for girls. The differences in the epidemiological data between the age groups clearly point to underdiagnosed ADHD in girls. Major depression, the most frequent psychiatric condition worldwide in adulthood, is twice as common in female as in male adults. Anxiety and depression are also among the most common comorbidities in adults with ADHD. Therefore, an undiagnosed ADHD may often underlie the psychopathology in depressive women. Another possibly associated phenomenon is the increased frequency of smoking in adult females. Since nicotine indirectly enhances the intrasynaptic dopamine level which presumably is too low both in ADHD and in depression, smoking might be used as a self-medication in women with untreated ADHD and consecutive depression. Furthermore, smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for ADHD in the offspring, so the vicious circle is complete. Depression in mothers of children with ADHD is associated with a higher rate of comorbidity in the children. Improved screening for ADHD in girls and treatment in childhood might thus reduce the rate of depression and smoking in adult females. We hypothesize that earlier identification and interventions might not only improve the lives of millions of girls and women but might also reduce the prevalence rates in future generations or at least moderate the deviant behaviour in this highly heritable disorder in which the development and severity of symptoms and the functional impairment depend to a high degree on epigenetic factors.}
